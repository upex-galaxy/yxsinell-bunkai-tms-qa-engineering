## Overview

***Source spec:*** FR-008

## User story

***As a*** Senior QA Engineer
***I want to*** add, edit, reorder and remove Acceptance Criteria under a User Story
***So that*** each Story spells out its testable behaviours in a clear order, and a Story cannot be marked ready to test until it actually has criteria.

## Definition of done

- [ ] Feature works end-to-end against staging
- [ ] Covered by an ATC chain anchored to a User Story + Acceptance Criterion
- [ ] Acceptance Criteria verified by QA
- [ ] Demoed to the team
