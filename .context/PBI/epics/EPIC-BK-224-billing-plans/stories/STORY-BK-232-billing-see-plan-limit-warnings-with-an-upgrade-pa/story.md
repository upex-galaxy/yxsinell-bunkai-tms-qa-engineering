## Overview

## User story

As Elena Vargas (Senior QA Engineer), I want a clear warning when my workspace approaches or hits a plan limit during my normal work, with an obvious path to resolution, so that a billing cap never turns into a confusing dead end in the middle of my flow.

## Context

Elena is not the payer — she is a member (or admin) doing TMS work: creating projects, running tests. When the workspace nears a plan limit she should see a non-blocking heads-up; when it hits the limit she should see a friendly block that explains what happened and routes her by role: owners go straight to the upgrade flow, non-owners are told who the workspace owner is so they can ask. Warnings surface across the whole app wherever a plan-limited resource is created, not only in Settings. Activates when plan limits are visible in the Billing section (plan/usage view live).
