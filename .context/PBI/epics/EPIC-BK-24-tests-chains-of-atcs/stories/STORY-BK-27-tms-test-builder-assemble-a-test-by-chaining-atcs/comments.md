## Acceptance Test Plan (ATP) — Shift-Left DRAFT ready for review

Shift-Left QA refinement complete. The full ATP DRAFT lives in the ***🧪 Acceptance Test Plan (ATP)**** field (customfield_10067). Refined acceptance criteria are in the ****✅ Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)*** field.

***Risk:*** HIGH. Key planning signal: the Story is effectively greenfield — the `tests` entity, the `activity_log` write path, and idempotency wiring do not yet exist in source (migrations <= 0020), so the current 3-SP estimate likely underscopes the work. See the Open Questions in the description and the full feasibility analysis in the ATP field before estimating.

## PO Perspective — Shift-Left Grooming (proposed answers, pending confirmation)

**Drafted to seed sprint-planning discussion. Each item restates the open question verbatim, then the PO's proposed answer. Status code on Q5 is left to Engineering by design.**

### Q1 — Is building the `tests` entity (table + ordered ATC join + create path + RLS) part of THIS Story, or assumed pre-built? (No tests table/route/UI exists — Story reads greenfield; 3-SP estimate likely wrong.)

***PO answer:*** In scope, and yes — the 3-SP estimate is wrong as written. The Test is the first deliverable of the BK-24 epic and the activation funnel KPI ("≥1 Module + ≥1 ATC + ≥1 Test + ≥1 Run in first 24h") cannot move without it, so the entity is the point of this Story, not a prerequisite. What I am NOT willing to do is let three subsystems ride in silently under a 3-SP label. Decision: the core `tests` table + ordered `test*atcs` join + create path + workspace RLS + the empty-chain / title / same-workspace validations stay in BK-27 and we re-estimate it (expect 5-8 SP). The `activity*log` write (Q4) and the idempotency dedupe (AC3 / agent retry) get carved into a sibling story BK-2x so they can be estimated and tested on their own merit. Re-estimate BK-27 at planning; do not commit it at 3 SP.

### Q2 — What is a 'selectable / published ATC'? AC1 says 'published' but `atcs.status` has no published state and no publish flag exists — AC1 precondition is untestable as written.

***PO answer:*** "Published" is loose wording in the source spec, not a real concept — drop it. We are NOT introducing an ATC publish lifecycle in MVP; that is scope we have deliberately not signed up for, and `atcs.status` is a run-lifecycle (unrun/running/pass/fail/...), not an authoring gate. Product rule: a "selectable ATC" is any non-archived ATC that lives in the active workspace and belongs to the same project context — full stop. Both Elena (UI picker) and Karim (headless) see the same selectable set; one rulebook, three executors. Reword AC1's precondition to "three ATCs from her workspace's library" and delete the word "published" everywhere it appears. If we ever add a draft/publish gate it becomes its own backlog story, not a hidden dependency of BK-27.

### Q4 — Is the `activity_log` write in scope? Table exists (0009) but has no runtime write path — DoD audit criterion is otherwise unverifiable.

***PO answer:**** The audit guarantee is in scope as a product promise — "a Test creation cannot be silently lost" is a business rule and the workspace owner must be able to audit who created what and when (it is also a selling point for our regulated-industry buyers). But the **implementation* of the first-ever runtime writer into `activity_log` is net-new plumbing that should not be smuggled under BK-27's number. Decision: split the activity-log writer into sibling story BK-2x alongside idempotency, and there define read visibility as owner-and-admin can audit (members do not need the audit view in MVP). BK-27's DoD line "Activity log records who created the Test" stays as the acceptance target, but it is satisfied by the sibling story landing in the same sprint — QA validates the audit entry once the writer exists. Until then that DoD line is explicitly blocked, not silently unmet.

### Q5 (product/copy) — Cross-workspace ATC rejection (AC4): the user-facing message copy + the product intent that it must NOT reveal whether the foreign ATC exists.

***PO answer:*** Non-disclosure is a hard product stance, not a nice-to-have — tenant isolation is the single most important promise a multi-tenant TMS makes, and a message that distinguishes "this ATC is in another workspace" from "this ATC does not exist" leaks the existence of another customer's data. So the rule is: the rejection for a foreign-workspace ATC and the rejection for a wholly-nonexistent ATC id MUST be byte-identical — same wording, same shape, no ID echoed back, no "belongs to another workspace" phrasing ever. Proposed user-facing copy: "One or more selected ATCs are not available in this workspace." That single sentence covers foreign, deleted, and never-existed alike without disclosing which. The exact HTTP status code is Engineering's call — I only require that whatever code is chosen is the same for both the foreign and the nonexistent case.

***Net scope recommendation:*** Re-estimate BK-27 (core entity + create path + RLS + validations, expect 5-8 SP, not 3) and split the activity-log writer + idempotency dedupe into a sibling story BK-2x so each is estimated and tested honestly.

## Engineering Perspective — Shift-Left Grooming (proposed answers, pending confirmation)

**Drafted to seed sprint-planning discussion. Each item restates the open question verbatim, then Engineering's proposed answer.**

### Q1 (feasibility & effort) — Is building the `tests` entity (table + ordered ATC join + create path + RLS) part of THIS Story? (No tests table/route/UI exists — Story reads greenfield; 3-SP estimate likely wrong.)

***Dev answer:**** Confirmed greenfield against the target repo: migrations run through `0020*import*jobs*one*active.sql` with no `tests` table, no `test*atcs` join, and no `/api/v1/tests` route — "New Test" is an unwired stub. The technical build inventory is: (1) a migration adding `tests` (header: id, workspace*id FK, title, created*by, timestamps) plus an ordered `test*atcs` join (test*id, atc*id, `position int`, duplicates allowed) with RLS `select/insert` policies gated by the existing `bunkai*is*workspace*member` / `bunkai*can*write*workspace` helpers from `0005*rls*helpers.sql`; (2) a `bunkai*save*test` plpgsql RPC mirroring the `bunkai*save*atc` (0007) `security invoker` + full-ordered-replace pattern, which re-validates server-side; (3) a `POST /api/v1/tests` route under `withApiHandler` + a server action for the UI; (4) the `activity*log` write (service-role, since 0009 is service-role-write-only); (5) the React "New Test" form with the ordered ATC picker + a Test list view. Honest effort read: this is ****not**** 3 SP. The schema + RPC + RLS + API + server-side validation is roughly a 3-SP slice on its own, and the ordered-picker UX is another 2-3 SP. I recommend ****splitting***: a backend predecessor (schema + RPC + RLS + API + activity*log + idempotency wiring, ~3 SP) and this Story as the UI builder on top (~3 SP). The in-scope/out-of-scope cut is the PO's call; my position is the 3-SP number only holds if the backend lands as a separate predecessor.

### Q3 — Define the idempotency window + retry-safe-identifier source (client-supplied vs server-derived); `idempotency_keys` table exists but is unwired today.

***Dev answer:**** Correction to the refinement: the middleware itself is ****already written**** at `lib/api/idempotency.ts` (begin / record / discard lifecycle, SHA-256 payload hashing, replay-snapshot return, 409 on same-key-different-payload) — it is just imported by ****zero**** handlers today, so the table is wired at the lib layer but not invoked by any route. Proposed mechanism, reusing that lib as-is: the client supplies an `Idempotency-Key` HTTP header — the ****agent/CI caller MUST supply one**** (per the workflow "agent provides a retry-safe identifier"), and the ****UI auto-generates a request UUID per form session*** and resends it on the double-click retry. The dedupe identity is the table's existing `unique (user*id, endpoint, key)`, with the payload SHA-256 (`request*hash`) guarding against key reuse with a different body. Window/TTL is the table default: `expires*at = now() + interval '24 hours'` (0009) — a 24h replay window, well beyond the double-click case. Server-derived fallback for clients that send no header: hash of `(user*id, endpoint, payload)` as a synthetic key so a naive double-submit still dedupes. Wiring is the one missing piece — call `beginIdempotentRequest` at the top of the new `POST /api/v1/tests` handler and `recordIdempotencyResult` on success.

### Q5 (status code & non-disclosure) — Exact status code + verbatim copy for the cross-workspace ATC rejection (AC4) — must be byte-identical to a nonexistent-ATC response or it leaks existence (INV-3).

***Dev answer:**** Status code is ****404 ****`not*found`, and the non-disclosure is enforced by RLS, not by application branching. The canonical pattern in the codebase (e.g. `app/api/v1/user-stories/[id]/route.ts`): the handler reads the referenced row with `.maybeSingle()`; an RLS-invisible row (foreign workspace) returns `null` exactly as a genuinely-nonexistent id does, and both paths throw the same `ApiError('not*found', ...)` → identical 404 status and identical body. So we never write a code branch that distinguishes "exists in another workspace" from "does not exist" — RLS collapses them upstream, which is what makes the responses byte-identical and satisfies INV-3. A ****403 would leak existence***: returning "forbidden" only happens when the server has confirmed the resource exists but the caller lacks rights, so a 403-vs-404 split tells the caller which foreign ATC ids are real. 422 would be wrong for the same reason (it implies the server processed and rejected a known-but-invalid reference). The `tests` create RPC must therefore resolve every chained ATC id through an RLS-scoped read and emit a uniform 404 if any id is unreadable. (User-facing message wording is the PO's; whatever copy is chosen must be the same string for both paths.)

### Q6 — ATC deletion behavior while referenced by a Test (RESTRICT vs cascade) + binding instant under a mid-form workspace switch.

***Dev answer:**** FK on-delete policy: `test*atcs.atc*id` should be `on delete restrict`, matching the existing meaningful-reference precedent `atcs.user*story*id ... on delete restrict` (0004) — a referenced ATC cannot be deleted while a Test depends on it, preventing orphaned chain positions and silent data loss. (Note: ATCs are not soft-deleted today; if soft-delete on ATCs is later added, "delete while referenced" becomes an application-level guard rather than an FK, but RESTRICT is the correct hard-delete posture now.) The `test*atcs.test*id` side stays `on delete cascade` so deleting a Test tears down its own join rows. Binding instant: the Test binds to the workspace active ****at save-commit time***, not form-open — the server action/RPC reads the active workspace from the authenticated session at the moment of submit and stamps `tests.workspace*id` from that, then `bunkai*save_test` re-validates that every chained ATC is readable under that same workspace's RLS. This resolves the mid-form-switch race deterministically: a workspace switch before Save simply re-targets both the binding and the ATC-visibility check to the new workspace, and any now-foreign ATC in the chain falls through to the uniform 404 from Q5.

***Effort read:*** Not 3 SP as a single greenfield item — recommend splitting into a backend predecessor (schema + RPC + RLS + activity_log + idempotency wiring, ~3 SP) and this Story as the UI test-builder on top (~3 SP); 3 SP only holds if the backend ships separately.

# BK-27 — Implementation Plan — Appendix

> Continuation of the Spec Implementation Plan (Dev) field — split due to Jira field content limit.

## Types & Type Safety

- Regenerate `lib/types/supabase.ts` via `bun run types:gen` after the migration (picks up `tests`, `test*steps`, `bunkai*create_test`). Generated file — mark `// generated, do not review` in the PR.
- New domain types live in `lib/tests/validation.ts` (`z.infer<typeof TestCreateBodySchema>`) and the `createTest` wrapper args in `lib/supabase/rpc.ts` — follow the `createAtc` wrapper shape (`lib/supabase/rpc.ts:85`).
- Import aliases: `@lib/**`, `@components/**`, `@app/*` only (this repo has NO `@api/`/`@schemas/` aliases — verified in `tsconfig.json`). Max 2 positional params; 3+ → object param.
- UI components type props from the generated row types; zero hand-rolled entity shapes.

---

## Content Writing (exact strings — glossary casing enforced)

| Context | Copy |
| --- | --- |
| Empty chain (server + UI, byte-identical) | `A Test must include at least one ATC.` |
| Foreign/nonexistent ATC (server, rendered verbatim by UI) | `One or more selected ATCs are not available in this workspace.` |
| Title required | `Title is required.` |
| Title too long | `Title must be 200 characters or fewer.` |
| Builder heading | `New Test` |
| Builder helper line | `Chain ATCs from your workspace library — selection order is run order.` |
| UI soft cap | `Chains are limited to 100 ATCs in the UI.` |

Never "test case", "test component", or "published ATC" anywhere (UI, code comments, OpenAPI descriptions).

---

## Unit-Test Plan (bun:test, colocated `*.test.ts` — no `test` script; run `bun test`)

| Step | Test file | Cases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | `lib/tests/validation.ts` → `lib/tests/validation.test.ts` | Title: trim-then-validate, whitespace-only rejected, 1-char OK, 200 OK, 201 rejected; chain: `[]` rejected, 1 OK, duplicates OK, non-uuid rejected; `workspace_id` optional; schema parse table tests (TC-04/05/09/10 fast layer) |
| 4 | `lib/tests/errors.ts` → `lib/tests/errors.test.ts` | SQLSTATE map: 42501→403 `forbidden`; 45120→422 `chain*empty` + exact copy; 45121→422; 45122→404 `not*found` + exact copy + NO details/id echo; unknown→500 (TC-06/07 mapping layer) |
| 9 | `lib/tests/rls-isolation.test.ts` (env-gated, `rls-parity.test.ts` pattern) | WS-X member reads zero WS-Y `tests`/`test_steps`; foreign-ATC create via RPC → uniform error; viewer RPC → 42501 (TC-13, TC-06/07 DB layer) |

RPC business rules (order preservation, duplicates, activity_log row, idempotent replay) are verified via Step 2/6 `verify:` checks and the env-gated suite. E2E is out of scope for this plan (owned by `/sprint-testing`).

## Dependencies

- [ ] BK-18 (ATC create/edit REST API) — dev-done, provides the route/RPC/error patterns being cloned. Present.
- [ ] Migrations 0001–0023 applied to the target DB (esp. 0005 helpers, 0009 `idempotency*keys`/`activity*log`, 0021 RPC precedent). Present.
- [ ] Supabase creds in `.env` for `types:gen` + env-gated tests (read from `.env`, never hardcode).
- [ ] ***Orchestrator******:****** add the §5 ratification entry for the builder derivation (Decisions 17–18) before Step 7 begins.***
- [ ] ***Orchestrator******:****** draft ****`ADR-0002-idempotency-key-scoping`**** (Decision 3); also fix the stale ADR README index (ADR-0001 missing) when it lands.***
- [ ] Branch: `feature/BK-27-test-builder` off `staging`; merge `--no-ff` into `staging`.

## Risks & Mitigations

***Risk 1 — Sibling "BK-2x" was never created; idempotency + audit tests (TC-12/14/16) had no owning story.***

- Impact: High (coverage orphaned, DoD audit line "blocked").
- Mitigation: this plan absorbs both write paths (Steps 2 and 6) at marginal cost; Decision 4 flags the PO confirmation. DoD audit line becomes satisfiable, not blocked.

***Risk 2 — ATP count mismatch (19 synced vs 25 claimed).***

- Impact: Medium (silent coverage gap if Jira truly holds 25).
- Mitigation: traceability note above; orchestrator re-syncs BK-27 before Stage 2 and extends the map if new outlines appear.

***Risk 3 — Builder UI has no authored mockup (placeholder ****`TestDetail`****).***

- Impact: Medium (design-fidelity defect if invented silently).
- Mitigation: derive-by-analogy spec written above; §5 ratification entry is a hard pre-Step-7 dependency.

***Risk 4 — First idempotency consumer sets a repo-wide precedent.***

- Impact: Medium (wrong scoping is hard to reverse once agents depend on it).
- Mitigation: defaults match the already-built 0009 schema exactly (no new semantics invented); ADR-0002 documents it; replay/409/discard paths covered by Step 6 verify + curls.

***Risk 5 — Review workload is High (******~******1.9k weighted lines).***

- Impact: High (review quality collapse past 400 lines/PR).
- Mitigation: feature-branch-chain proposed below; generated types excluded; OpenAPI sibling and SQL are low-cognitive-density.

## Estimated Effort

| Step | Time |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Migration: schema + RLS | 3h |
| 2. Migration: RPC + activity log | 5h |
| 3. Types regen | 0.5h |
| 4. Domain layer (validation/errors/codes/wrapper) | 4h |
| 5. API handler + OpenAPI | 4h |
| 6. Idempotency wiring | 2h |
| 7. UI builder | 8h |
| 8. Explorer Tests group | 3h |
| 9. Verification sweep | 2.5h |
| ***Total**** | ****32h ≈ 4 dev-days*** |

***Story points******:*** 8 (matches the PO re-estimate and the epic story table).

## Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] All 9 steps implemented per this plan; every `verify:` line observed
- [ ] All 10 AC scenarios + all 19 synced ATP TCs traceable to passing behavior (table above)
- [ ] Backend types used throughout (`lib/types/supabase.ts` regenerated; zero hand-rolled entity shapes)
- [ ] Glossary casing exact in all UI copy + identifiers (Test, ATC, chain; `test_steps`)
- [ ] Non-disclosure verified: foreign vs nonexistent ATC responses byte-identical
- [ ] activity_log row asserted for every successful creation (DoD audit line satisfied in-RPC)
- [ ] Idempotency replay verified (UI double-submit + headless retry)

## Ready For QA — staging deploy

> ***SUCCESS:*** BK-27 merged to `staging` and auto-deployed. All 10 AC scenarios + 19 ATP TCs traceable (see the `compliance-matrix.md` artifact and the Spec Implementation Plan field).

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PR | https://github.com/upex-galaxy/upex-bunkai-tms/pull/40 (merge `54749ba`) |
| Branch | `feature/BK-27-test-builder` → `staging` |
| Staging | https://staging-upexbunkai.vercel.app |
| Builder route | `/projects/{slug}/tests/new` |

***Verified before handoff***: 265 unit tests green; live-DB SQL suite (order preservation, duplicates, trim, 200/201 boundary, uniform non-disclosure 45122 incl. foreign/archived/NULL ids, viewer 42501, activity_log row); env-gated RLS isolation suite (3 pass / 16 asserts).

***QA focus on staging*** (HTTP-layer items marked review-approved in the compliance matrix):

1. Builder flow end-to-end: assemble a Test with 3 ATCs incl. one duplicate — chain order must equal selection order; Test appears in the explorer Tests group.
2. Double-submit (TC-12): rapid double-click on Create Test → exactly one Test.
3. Headless retry (TC-16/17): `POST /api/v1/tests` with PAT + same `Idempotency-Key` twice → one Test, identical responses; omitting `workspace_id` → 422.
4. Validation copy verbatim: empty chain, whitespace title, 201-char title.

## Acceptance Test Results (ATR) — BK-27

***Status:**** PASSED | ****Date:**** 2026-06-17 | ****Environment:**** staging (staging-upexbunkai.vercel.app) | ****Modality:*** Jira-native

### Execution Summary

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total TCs | 19 |
| Passed | 16 |
| Deferred | 1 (N6 — viewer 403, no 2nd auth user on staging) |
| Partial | 1 (I1 — RLS SELECT, no GET endpoint) |
| Not Reproducible | 1 (I4 — UI WS switch destroys form) |
| Failed | 0 |
| Bugs Filed | 0 |

### Results by Category

***Positive (3/3 PASSED):*** P1 chain order (API+UI+DB), P2 duplicate ATC preserved, P3 single ATC accepted.

***Negative (5/6):*** N1 UI empty chain blocked, N2 API empty chain 422, N3 foreign ATC 404, N4 nonexistent ATC byte-identical, N5 archived ATC byte-identical. N6 DEFERRED (no viewer user).

***Boundary (4/4 PASSED):*** B1 title 200/201, B2 whitespace rejected, B3 trim works, B4 missing idempotency-key 400.

***Integration (2/4):*** I2 activity*log written atomically, I3 UI/headless parity verified. I1 PARTIAL (workspace*id stamps correct). I4 NOT REPRO (UI safety net).

***API/Idempotency (3/3 PASSED):*** A1 double-submit 1 row, A2 replay same key, A3 conflict 409 + missing workspace_id 422.

### Non-Disclosure Contract (INV-3): VERIFIED

N3/N4/N5 return byte-identical 404 responses for foreign, nonexistent, and archived ATCs. No id echo, no existence leak.

### Dev-Flagged Focus Areas: ALL VERIFIED

Builder E2E + duplicate ATC, double-submit dedup, headless idempotency retry, verbatim validation copy.

### Observations (Non-Blocking)

1. Zod pre-empts RPC for validation (N2, B1, B2) — generic messages instead of spec verbatim copy. Functionally correct.
2. I4 workspace switch navigates away — design-level safety net prevents mid-form binding-instant scenario via UI.

### Verdict: PASSED — QA recommends sign-off.
