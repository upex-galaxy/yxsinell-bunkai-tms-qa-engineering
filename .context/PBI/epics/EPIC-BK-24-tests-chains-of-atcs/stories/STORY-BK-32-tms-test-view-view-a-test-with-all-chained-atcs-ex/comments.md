# Shift-Left Review Update Summary - BK-32

## Executive Summary

BK-32 now has an Ely-style pre-sprint refinement package for the read-only expanded Test view. The Story is useful but should stay in refinement until PO/Dev resolve one contract conflict: BK-32 asks for an empty state when a Test has no ATCs, while BK-27 says a Test must always contain at least one ATC.

## Refinement Delta

| Area | Added / changed |
| --- | --- |
| Contract decisions | 8 decisions covering expanded endpoint, read-only behavior, live ATC content, permissions, safe errors, and zero-ATC state. |
| AC reconciliation | 9 rows mapping original BK-32 DoD to refined outcomes and owners. |
| Risk coverage | High risks now cover empty-chain conflict, cross-workspace data leakage, stale ATC content, and expanded-read performance. |
| ATP draft | 9 draft rows for UI/API/DB/manual coverage. |
| Readiness gates | PO contract, Dev feasibility, Data/API, UX, and Security/Ops remain Needs; QA testability is Pass. |

## ATP Draft Summary

- BK-32-ATC-01: Open Test with 3 ATCs and see all expanded.
- BK-32-ATC-02: Position numbers match saved execution order.
- BK-32-ATC-03: Edited ATC content appears in expanded Test view.
- BK-32-ATC-04: ATC with no assertions or no steps renders clear section state.
- BK-32-ATC-05: Zero-ATC Test shows empty state if PO/Dev confirm the model allows it.
- BK-32-ATC-06: Cross-workspace Test access is denied without leakage.
- BK-32-ATC-07: View exposes no edit, reorder, add, or remove controls.
- BK-32-ATC-08: 7-ATC expanded read meets the BK-24 p95 target.
- BK-32-ATC-09: Long steps/assertions remain readable.

## High / Medium Risks

| Severity | Risk | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| High | Empty-state AC conflicts with BK-27 no-empty-Test rule. | AC Boundary / BK-32-ATC-05 |
| High | Cross-workspace user sees another workspace's Test/ATC details. | AC Negative / BK-32-ATC-06 |
| High | Expanded view shows stale ATC content after an ATC edit. | AC Happy / BK-32-ATC-03 |
| High | Expanded read becomes slow or N+1 for a 7-ATC Test. | AC Integration / BK-32-ATC-08 |
| Medium | Position numbering differs from saved execution order. | BK-32-ATC-02 |
| Medium | Read-only page accidentally exposes mutation controls. | BK-32-ATC-07 |

## Open Confirmations

- PO/Dev: Should zero-ATC Tests exist for BK-32, or should the empty-state AC be removed?
- Dev: Confirm final route: `GET /tests/{id}?expand=atcs.steps,atcs.assertions` vs `/api/v1/tests/{id}?expand=atcs.steps,atcs.assertions`.
- Dev/PO: Confirm live-reference behavior for ATC edits vs versioned snapshot behavior.
- Security/Dev: Confirm viewer read permission and hidden cross-workspace behavior.
- Design: Confirm always-expanded default and long-content rendering.

## Dependency Note

- BK-32 depends on BK-27 for Test assembly and canonical chain order.
- BK-24 provides BK-017 and the <500ms p95 expanded-read target for a 7-ATC Test.
- BK-28 provides adjacent chain-order semantics.
- BK-70 may conflict or clarify whether draft Tests without ATCs can exist.

## Out Of Scope

- Test creation, reorder, execution, edit/add/remove ATCs, Jira/Xray test case creation, QA execution evidence, and transition to Estimation.

## Publication Status

- Description: published with full shift-left refinement.
- Comment mirror: this comment.
- Labels/status: to be verified after publication.
- Ownership handback: PO + Dev for confirmations before estimation.

# BK-32: TMS-Test View | View a test with all chained ATCs expanded

## Metadata Snapshot

- Jira key: BK-32
- Status: Backlog
- Priority / points: Medium / unknown
- Reporter / assignee: Ely / Unassigned
- Labels: none before publication
- Last updated before refinement: 2026-06-09T16:06:12.893-0300

## User Story

As a QA Engineer, I want to open a Test and see all of its chained ATCs expanded in order, each showing its steps and assertions in a single read-only view, so that I can review exactly what the Test will validate, in the exact sequence it will run, before I commit to executing it.

## Source & Evidence

- Source spec: BK-017
- Parent epic/module: BK-24 Tests (chains of ATCs)
- Evidence used: Jira BK-32 description, Jira dependency link to BK-27, BK-24 epic context, BK-27/BK-28 local story context, BK-70 Test Repository context, Engram memories for Ely-style shift-left structure and BK-39 publication learnings.
- Evidence labels used: Jira | Repo | Engram | Inference

## Shift-Left Review Status

- Verdict: Needs PO confirmation and Dev confirmation
- Summary: The read-only expanded Test view is valuable and testable, but one contract conflict must be resolved before estimation: BK-32 expects a no-ATC empty state, while BK-27 states a Test cannot exist without at least one ATC. Dev also needs to confirm the exact read endpoint path, response shape, auth/RLS behavior, and whether expanded reads use live ATC content or versioned snapshots.

## Expert Review Summary

| Role | Finding | Recommendation | Confirmation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PO | Empty-state AC conflicts with BK-27's no-empty-Test rule. | Confirm whether BK-32 supports draft/legacy/deleted-chain Tests with zero ATCs, or remove empty-state AC from this Story. | Needs confirmation |
| Dev | Source spec names `GET /tests/{id}?expand=atcs.steps,atcs.assertions`, while repo APIs usually live under `/api/v1`. | Confirm final route and response schema before implementation. | Needs confirmation |
| QA | Existing ACs cover happy path but miss auth, missing Test, data leak, stale ATC content, and performance. | Add negative, boundary, integration, and performance-oriented ATP rows. | Confirmed as QA recommendation |
| Design | Read-only expanded steps/assertions can become visually dense. | Confirm expanded default, long content handling, and empty-state copy. | Needs confirmation |
| Security | Expanded response includes reusable ATC details and assertions. | Enforce workspace-scoped read access and avoid revealing foreign Test/ATC existence. | Needs Dev confirmation |
| Workflow | BK-32 was in Backlog with no comments before refinement. | Publish description, QA mirror comment, labels, and move only to Shift-Left QA. Do not move to Estimation until confirmations are resolved. | Applied |

## Scope

### In Scope

- Open a Test detail/read view.
- Show every ATC in the Test chain expanded inline.
- Preserve the saved execution order.
- Show each ATC's ordered steps.
- Show each ATC's ordered assertions.
- Show a top-level ATC count.
- Keep the view strictly read-only.
- Reflect the latest saved ATC content, if confirmed as live-reference behavior.
- Show an empty state only if PO/Dev confirm zero-ATC Tests can exist.

### Out of Scope

- Creating a Test.
- Reordering ATCs.
- Adding or removing ATCs from a Test.
- Editing ATCs from this view.
- Starting or executing a Manual Run.
- Formal Jira/Xray test case creation.
- QA execution, ATR, screenshots, traces, or pass/fail evidence.

### Deferred / Follow-up Stories

- Manual Run execution from Test definition.
- Activity-log UI for Test view opens.
- Versioned/snapshot Test definition view, if live ATC propagation is not desired.
- Add/remove ATCs after Test creation, if not already covered elsewhere.

## Dependency Map

| Dependency | Type | Impact | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BK-24 | formal | Parent epic defines BK-017 expanded read and <500ms p95 target for a 7-ATC Test. | PO/Dev | Planning context exists |
| BK-27 | formal / functional | Defines Test assembly, chain order, workspace rules, and no-empty-Test rule. | PO/Dev | Shift-Left QA |
| BK-28 | functional | Defines reorder behavior and confirms order comes from stored chain positions. | Dev/QA | Shift-Left QA |
| BK-70 | inferred | Defines broader Test Repository model and may allow draft Tests without ATC links. | Dev/PO | Backlog |
| ATC Library / BK-13 | functional | Expanded view depends on ATC steps/assertions existing and being readable. | Dev | Prior dependency |
| Auth/RLS | inferred | Expanded Test/ATC data must be scoped to active workspace membership. | Dev/Security | Needs confirmation |

## Key Contract Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Source | Confirmation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expanded read endpoint returns Test header plus ordered ATC chain with steps and assertions. | BK-017 explicitly names expanded read and BK-32 needs one read-only review surface. | Repo/Jira | Needs Dev confirmation |
| Final route should follow project API convention if different from source shorthand. | BK-017 says `GET /tests/{id}`, but existing API convention commonly uses `/api/v1`. | Repo/Inference | Needs Dev confirmation |
| ATC order is canonical from the saved Test chain, not client-side sorting. | BK-27/BK-28 define order preservation and position semantics. | Repo | Needs Dev confirmation |
| Expanded content should be read-only with no edit/reorder/add/remove controls. | BK-32 explicitly says strictly read-only. | Jira | Confirmed |
| Expanded ATC content should reflect latest saved ATC version. | Original BK-32 DoD says edits made elsewhere appear here. | Jira | Needs Dev confirmation |
| Zero-ATC empty state is conditional. | BK-32 asks for it, but BK-27 says no empty Test exists. | Jira/Repo | Needs PO/Dev confirmation |
| Viewer/read permissions must be explicit. | Read-only view may be allowed to viewer, but cross-workspace data must never leak. | Repo/Inference | Needs Dev/Security confirmation |
| Missing or unauthorized Test should return safe error behavior. | BK-70 uses `TEST*NOT*FOUND`/`UNAUTHORIZED`; hidden foreign records should not reveal existence. | Repo/Inference | Needs Dev confirmation |

## AC Reconciliation

| Original AC / source claim | Evidence | Refined outcome | Reason | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Opening a Test shows every ATC expanded inline, in saved order. | Jira BK-32, BK-24 BK-017 | kept | Core value of Story. | PO |
| Each expanded ATC shows ordered steps and assertions. | Jira BK-32, BK-017 | kept | Observable output needed for review before execution. | PO/QA |
| View is strictly read-only. | Jira BK-32 | kept | Prevents this Story from absorbing edit/reorder scope. | PO/Design |
| Position number matches execution order. | Jira BK-32, BK-27/BK-28 | kept | Required to trust what will run. | Dev/QA |
| Test with no ATCs shows empty state. | Jira BK-32 vs BK-27 conflict | changed | Mark conditional until PO/Dev resolve data-model conflict. | PO/Dev |
| Summary count visible at top. | Jira BK-32 | kept | Low-cost usability and quick validation. | Design/QA |
| Latest saved ATC version appears here. | Jira BK-32, BK-21 pattern | kept with confirmation | Needs live-reference vs snapshot contract. | Dev |
| Unauthorized or cross-workspace access missing from original ACs. | Repo RLS patterns | added | Security/testability gap. | Dev/Security |
| Missing Test behavior missing from original ACs. | BK-70 API pattern | added | Negative path needed for API/UI reliability. | QA |

## Refined Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Background:
  Given Elena is signed in to workspace "Acme QA"
    And Elena has read access to the project
    And Test "Add to Cart from Empty State" exists in that workspace
    And the Test has an ATC chain saved in execution order
    And each chained ATC has ordered steps and ordered assertions

Scenario: Elena views a Test with all chained ATCs expanded in execution order
  Given the Test contains ATCs [ATC-A, ATC-B, ATC-C]
  When Elena opens the Test detail view
  Then the view shows ATC-A as position 1, ATC-B as position 2, and ATC-C as position 3
    And each ATC is expanded inline
    And each ATC shows its ordered steps
    And each ATC shows its ordered assertions
    And the top summary shows "3 ATCs"

Scenario: Expanded view reflects the latest saved ATC content
  Given ATC-B was edited elsewhere and its latest saved version has 4 steps and 2 assertions
  When Elena opens or refreshes the Test detail view
  Then ATC-B shows the latest saved 4 steps and 2 assertions
    And the Test chain order remains unchanged

Scenario: The expanded Test view is strictly read-only
  Given Elena is viewing the expanded Test
  Then she cannot edit ATC title, steps, assertions, or chain position from this view
    And she cannot add or remove ATCs from this view
    And no reorder controls are available in this view

Scenario: User cannot view a Test from another workspace
  Given Pablo belongs to workspace "Other Co"
  When Pablo attempts to open a Test owned by workspace "Acme QA"
  Then the system denies access without exposing the foreign Test's ATCs, steps, or assertions

Scenario: Missing Test shows a safe not-found state
  Given the requested Test id does not exist or is not visible to the current user
  When the user opens the Test view
  Then the system shows a safe not-found state
    And no ATC details are displayed

Scenario: Test has no ATCs yet
  Given PO and Dev have confirmed zero-ATC Tests can exist
    And Test "Draft Checkout Flow" has no ATCs
  When Elena opens the Test detail view
  Then the view shows a clear empty state
    And the top summary shows "0 ATCs"
    And the page is not blank

Scenario: Expanded read returns full chain in one round trip
  Given the Test contains 7 ATCs
  When the client requests the expanded Test read with steps and assertions
  Then the response includes the Test header, ordered ATC chain, steps, and assertions in one response
    And the response meets the BK-24 target of <500ms p95 for a 7-ATC Test
```

## Business Rules

- Confirmed: The view is read-only; it must not edit, reorder, add, or remove ATCs.
- Confirmed: The displayed ATC position must match the saved Test execution order.
- Confirmed: The top of the view must show the ATC count.
- Confirmed: Expanded ATCs must include steps and assertions.
- Needs confirmation: Expanded ATC content reflects latest saved ATC content rather than a version snapshot.
- Needs confirmation: A zero-ATC Test can exist and should show an empty state.
- Inference: Read access should be workspace-scoped and should allow viewer/member/admin/owner roles unless Dev confirms stricter rules.
- Inference: Unauthorized and cross-workspace reads should not leak foreign Test/ATC existence.

## Edge Cases & Risk Matrix

| Severity | Edge case | Expected behavior | Mitigation | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High | Empty-state AC conflicts with BK-27 no-empty-Test rule. | PO/Dev decide whether to keep, scope, or remove empty-state behavior. | Gate estimation until decision. | AC Boundary / BK-32-ATC-05 |
| High | Cross-workspace user opens another workspace's Test. | Access denied and no ATC details leaked. | RLS plus API permission check. | AC Negative / BK-32-ATC-06 |
| High | Expanded view shows stale ATC content after ATC edit. | Latest saved content appears if live-reference contract is confirmed. | Confirm live-reference vs snapshot behavior. | AC Happy / BK-32-ATC-03 |
| High | Expanded read causes N+1 or slow page for 7 ATCs. | One response and <500ms p95 target. | API-level expanded read, performance check. | AC Integration / BK-32-ATC-08 |
| Medium | Missing steps or assertions render as blank content. | ATC row still visible with clear empty section labels. | UX fallback for empty child arrays. | BK-32-ATC-04 |
| Medium | Position numbering differs from execution order. | Position labels match canonical chain order. | Source from persisted chain position only. | BK-32-ATC-02 |
| Medium | Read-only page accidentally exposes edit/reorder controls. | No mutation controls available. | UI assertions and permission review. | BK-32-ATC-07 |
| Low | Long step/assertion text makes view hard to scan. | Content remains readable without hiding required detail. | Design confirmation for wrapping/collapse rules. | BK-32-ATC-09 |

## ATP Draft Matrix

| ID | Type | Scenario | Coverage target | Priority | Automation hint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BK-32-ATC-01 | Happy | Open Test with 3 ATCs and see all expanded. | Core read-only value. | High | UI/API |
| BK-32-ATC-02 | Happy | Position numbers match saved execution order. | Order integrity. | High | UI/DB |
| BK-32-ATC-03 | Integration | Edited ATC content appears in expanded Test view. | Latest saved ATC propagation. | High | API/DB |
| BK-32-ATC-04 | Boundary | ATC with no assertions or no steps renders clear section state. | Child content rendering. | Medium | UI/API |
| BK-32-ATC-05 | Boundary | Zero-ATC Test shows empty state if confirmed. | Contract conflict resolution. | High | UI/API |
| BK-32-ATC-06 | Negative | Cross-workspace Test access denied without leakage. | RLS/security. | High | API/DB |
| BK-32-ATC-07 | Negative | View exposes no edit, reorder, add, or remove controls. | Read-only contract. | High | UI |
| BK-32-ATC-08 | Integration | 7-ATC expanded read completes under p95 target. | Performance target. | Medium | API |
| BK-32-ATC-09 | UX | Long steps/assertions remain readable. | Usability. | Low | Manual/UI |

## Open Clarifications With Expert Recommendations

### PO - Zero-ATC Test Empty State

- Question: Should BK-32 support a Test with no ATCs even though BK-27 says a Test must contain at least one ATC?
- Expert recommendation: Keep the empty-state AC only if the product supports draft/legacy/deleted-chain Tests; otherwise remove it from BK-32 and treat blank Test creation as out of scope.
- Pending confirmation: PO and Dev

### Dev - Expanded Read Endpoint Contract

- Question: Is the final endpoint `GET /tests/{id}?expand=atcs.steps,atcs.assertions` or the project-standard `/api/v1/tests/{id}?expand=atcs.steps,atcs.assertions`?
- Expert recommendation: Use the project-standard API namespace if all v1 routes follow `/api/v1`, while preserving BK-017 as the functional source.
- Pending confirmation: Dev

### Dev - Live ATC Content vs Snapshot

- Question: Should the expanded Test read always show latest saved ATC content, or content as captured when the Test was assembled?
- Expert recommendation: Use live-reference behavior for MVP because BK-32 explicitly says edits made elsewhere appear here; introduce snapshots only if audit/versioned execution needs it later.
- Pending confirmation: Dev and PO

### Security - Read Permission

- Question: Can viewer-role users open the read-only expanded Test view?
- Expert recommendation: Allow viewer read access inside the same workspace, deny all cross-workspace access, and return safe not-found/forbidden behavior without leaking ATC existence.
- Pending confirmation: Security and Dev

### Design - Expanded Content Presentation

- Question: Should all ATCs be expanded by default, or should long chains use accordion behavior while still satisfying "expanded inline"?
- Expert recommendation: For MVP, show all expanded by default for chains up to the 7-ATC target; consider progressive collapse later if real usage shows scanning problems.
- Pending confirmation: Design

## Implementation Readiness Gates

| Gate | Status | Evidence | Blocker / Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PO contract | Needs | Empty-state conflict between BK-32 and BK-27. | Confirm or remove zero-ATC behavior. |
| Dev feasibility | Needs | Endpoint/response shape not present in Jira comments. | Confirm route, response schema, and live-reference behavior. |
| QA testability | Pass | Scenarios are observable through UI/API/DB. | Needs test data for 0, 3, and 7 ATC chains. |
| Data/API | Needs | BK-017 exists in epic, but exact contract needs confirmation. | Define expanded payload and error envelope. |
| UX | Needs | Read-only and empty-state behavior need final copy/layout decisions. | Confirm rendering rules. |
| Security/Ops | Needs | Cross-workspace expanded data leakage is high risk. | Confirm RLS and permission behavior. |

## Handoff Notes

- For PO: Decide whether zero-ATC Tests exist for BK-32.
- For Dev: Confirm endpoint path, response payload, live-reference behavior, permission model, and not-found/forbidden behavior.
- For QA: Prioritize order integrity, read-only controls, cross-workspace denial, latest ATC content, and p95 7-ATC expanded read.
- For Automation: Good candidates are API contract tests for expanded payload and UI assertions for read-only expanded rendering.
- Not requested / not done: No formal Jira/Xray test cases, no test execution evidence, no move to Estimation.

## QA Handoff Mirror

- Executive summary: BK-32 is a read-only expanded Test view story. It is valuable but not ready for estimation until the zero-ATC conflict and endpoint/payload contract are confirmed.
- Refinement delta: Added 8 contract decisions, 9 AC reconciliation rows, high-risk coverage, ATP draft rows, and explicit PO/Dev/Security/Design confirmations.
- ATP draft summary: Cover happy expanded view, order numbering, latest ATC propagation, zero-ATC state, cross-workspace denial, read-only UI, performance, and long-content UX.
- High/Medium risks: Empty-chain conflict, cross-workspace data leak, stale ATC content, slow expanded read, accidental mutation controls, blank child sections.
- Open confirmations: PO/Dev zero-ATC behavior; Dev endpoint/payload/live-reference; Security read permissions; Design expanded layout.
- Dependency note: Formal dependency on BK-27 and BK-24; functional alignment with BK-28 order semantics and BK-70 Test Repository assumptions.
- Out of scope: Test creation, reorder, execution, edit/add/remove ATCs, Jira/Xray TCs, QA execution evidence.
- Publication status: Description and QA mirror published by Shift-Left QA; labels and status handled separately in publication checklist.

## Publication Checklist

- Description updated: yes
- AC field updated: no - acli cannot safely edit existing custom rich/text fields here without REST permission alignment
- ATP DRAFT or comment mirror updated: yes
- Labels applied: pending verification
- Transition status: target Shift-Left QA, not Estimation
- Rendered verification: pending re-read
- Ownership handback: PO and Dev

# Expert Panel Decision Update - BK-32

## Verdict

The expert panel recommends keeping BK-32 in refinement, not Estimation, until PO/Dev confirm two contract points: zero-ATC behavior and final route path.

## Decisions Applied To Story Fields

| Question | Recommendation | Pending? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Zero-ATC empty state | Do not treat zero-ATC Test as the default BK-32 behavior. Empty state only applies if PO/Dev confirm draft/legacy/deleted-chain recovery. | Yes |
| Endpoint route | Use `/api/v1/tests/{id}?expand=atcs.steps,atcs.assertions` as refinement default; keep `/tests/{id}` as source-spec shorthand. | Dev confirmation |
| Live content vs snapshot | Expanded Test view should show latest saved ATC content. Snapshots belong to Run/history/audit. | No |
| Viewer read permissions | Viewer can read expanded Test details inside the same workspace; cross-workspace access must not leak data. | No |
| Expanded UX | Show all chained ATCs expanded by default for MVP. Optional accordion can come later only if it does not hide required content by default. | Design confirmation useful, not blocking |

## Jira Publication Note

- US field should hold the concise canonical contract.
- Existing comments `11583` and `11584` remain as historical QA handoff/refinement context.
- No new full duplicate package should be added.
- Labels requested: `shift-left-reviewed`, `shift-left-2026-06-14`, `needs-po-confirmation`, `needs-dev-confirmation`, `tests-epic`.
- Target status: `Shift-Left QA`, not `Estimation`.

# Spec Implementation Plan (Dev) — Appendix

> Overflow from the Spec Implementation Plan (Dev) field (CONTENT_LIMIT). Core plan (Overview, Technical Approach, Data Model, Domain/API/UI layers, Implementation Steps) is in the field.

## Traceability — ATP TC + AC → Implementation Steps

> BK-32-ATC-05 (zero-ATC empty state) is DROPPED per confirmation §3.1. All other in-scope ATP rows and Gherkin ACs are mapped; none unmapped.

| ATP / AC | Title (abridged) | Steps that make it pass |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BK-32-ATC-01 | Open Test with 3 ATCs, all expanded inline | 1 (compose), 4 (route), 5 (TestDetailView/cards) |
| BK-32-ATC-02 | Position numbers match saved execution order | 1 (`order by test_steps.position`), 5 (render in array order) |
| BK-32-ATC-03 | Edited ATC content appears (live, not snapshot) | 1 (joins live atcs/steps/assertions at query time), 4, 5 |
| BK-32-ATC-04 | ATC with 0 steps / 0 assertions → clear section state | 1 (`coalesce '[]'`), 5 (empty-section copy) |
| ~~BK-32-ATC-05~~ | ~~Zero-ATC empty state~~ | DROPPED (§3.1 — BK-27 requires ≥1 ATC) |
| BK-32-ATC-06 | Cross-workspace access denied, no leakage | 1 (read-membership assert, uniform P0002), 3 (P0002→404), 4, 7 (isolation test) |
| BK-32-ATC-07 | No edit/add/remove/reorder controls anywhere | 5 (pure projection, no mutation affordances) |
| BK-32-ATC-08 | 7-ATC expanded read meets p95 (one round trip) | 1 (single composed RPC, no N+1), 4, 7 (perf sanity) |
| BK-32-ATC-09 | Long steps/assertions remain readable | 5 (wrap/break-words, no hiding) |
| AC Happy (open populated, expanded, ordered, "N ATCs") | — | 1, 4, 5 |
| AC Read-only | — | 5 |
| AC Order (longer chain 1..n, no gaps/repeats) | — | 1 (position ordering), 5 |
| AC Live (latest saved ATC version) | — | 1, 4, 5 |
| AC Not-found (missing/deleted → safe state, way back, no ATC content) | — | 1 (P0002), 3, 5 (notFound page) |
| AC Cross-workspace (denied, non-disclosing) | — | 1, 3, 4, 7 |
| AC Perf (one round trip, <500ms p95 @ 7 ATCs) | — | 1, 4, 7 |

## Technical Decisions

> Story-local decisions. Only genuinely cross-cutting + hard-to-reverse items are flagged as ADR candidates.

| # | Question | Decision | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Zero-ATC empty state? | NO. A Test requires ≥1 ATC (BK-27 rule wins). BK-32-ATC-05 + "Test has no ATCs" Gherkin scenario DROPPED. `business-rules.md` line ~10 is ***overridden*** by this plan; recommend PM/glossary reconcile the story field (do NOT edit from the plan). | DECIDED (per §3.1; PM reconciliation recommended, non-blocking) |
| 2 | Read architecture: DEFINER RPC vs RLS nested select | ***DEFINER RPC ***`bunkai*get*test*expanded` with explicit `p*actor*user*id` + in-band read-membership re-check. RLS nested select is unusable from the admin-client API route (NULL `auth.uid()`); RPC keeps one rulebook across both surfaces and isolates non-disclosure logic in one place. | DECIDED-IN-PLAN |
| 3 | Read-level membership helper | NEW `bunkai*assert*actor*can*read_workspace` (any active role incl. viewer), raising P0002 (not 42501) for non-disclosure. Existing write-asserts wrongly deny viewers. | DECIDED-IN-PLAN |
| 4 | `expand` query param handling | Accept and IGNORE — always return fully expanded (minimal viable). Documented in OpenAPI. Conditional composition is dead weight; the only consumer needs full expansion. | DECIDED-IN-PLAN |
| 5 | Not-found code | Reuse canonical `not*found` (404), non-disclosing copy `Test not found.`. NO new `test*not_found` code (a distinct code is itself a weak existence signal; mirrors `mapAtcRpcError` P0002 + BK-27 D5). No error-envelope/registry edits. | DECIDED-IN-PLAN |
| 6 | PAT scope for the read | Reuse the existing read auth path (`auth: 'required'`, no `requires` write scope). No new PAT scope (§3.4 / BK-27 D16 parity). | DECIDED-IN-PLAN |
| 7 | UI surface (tab vs routed page) | ***Routed page*** `/projects/{slug}/tests/{testId}`, by analogy with `atcs/[atcId]/page.tsx`; explorer rows become `Link`s (mirrors `AtcTable`). BK-27 explicitly deferred the in-pane `t:` tab to BK-32; a routed page is the lower-risk, deep-linkable choice and matches the §8 "Projects detail (test view)" row. | DECIDED-IN-PLAN |
| 8 | Derived Test-detail screen (no authored mockup) | DERIVED by analogy (ATCDetail steps/assertions/used-by anatomy + BK-27 explorer Tests group). ***Orchestrator must record this as a §5 ratified divergence in ****`master-design-plan.md`**** before Stage 2 UI work*** (Critical Rule #15 — silent invention is a defect). Suggested §5 entry text provided below. | DECIDED-IN-PLAN (ratification entry required) |
| 9 | `step*id` in payload | Include `test*steps.id` per chain item now (stable reorder handle for BK-28; React key for BK-32). Additive, no cost. | DECIDED-IN-PLAN |
| 10 | Snapshot vs live | Live references only (§3.3). No snapshot column added; reads join live tables at request time. | DECIDED-IN-PLAN |

***No ADR candidate flagged.**** The read-contract / RPC-vs-RLS choice (Decision 2) is a **direct application* of the already-ratified ADR-0001 admin-client + explicit-actor doctrine and the established `bunkai*get*atc` precedent — it introduces no new cross-cutting, hard-to-reverse policy. (Contrast: BK-27 flagged idempotency-key scoping as an ADR candidate because that genuinely set new cross-cutting policy.)

***Suggested §5 ratification entry (for the orchestrator to add to ****`master-design-plan.md`****)******:***

> D10 (or next free) | Test detail view (BK-32): mockup `TestDetail` is a placeholder (`project.jsx:564-570`) — no authored spec | ***UI (derived)**** | ****Ratified DERIVATION (BK-32 Stage 1).*** Read-only expanded Test view implemented as a routed page `/projects/{slug}/tests/{testId}` (analogy with `atcs/[atcId]` detail page); explorer Test rows become navigating `Link`s (mirrors `AtcTable`). Each ATC rendered as an expanded card reusing ATCDetail anatomy: "Used by"-row header (`project.jsx:528-546`), ordered steps `<ol>` (`:476-501`), stacked assertions `<code>` (`:502-518`) — neutral styling, no pass/fail color (no Runs, §7 gate). Frozen §2 tokens only. Strictly read-only (no edit/add/remove/reorder — those are BK-28+). Empty per-section state for ATCs with 0 steps/0 assertions; NO zero-ATC empty Test (BK-27 ≥1-ATC rule wins, overrides BK-32 `business-rules.md` line ~10).

NOTE: ATC-05 (zero-ATC empty state) DROPPED per Dev decision Section 3.1 because BK-27 requires at least one ATC.

## Summary

BK-32 was validated on staging for the read-only expanded Test view across API, security, performance, and UX-oriented data coverage. The executed coverage confirms that GET /api/v1/tests/{id} returns Test header data plus ordered ATC chain, steps, and assertions in one response; live ATC edits are reflected without snapshots; missing and foreign Tests are handled with non-disclosing 404 responses; mutation methods are blocked; and the expanded read meets the target performance threshold.

The story is acceptable for QA sign-off. The only follow-up is requirements cleanup: remove or reconcile the old zero-ATC scenario because the implemented product contract requires a Test to contain at least one ATC.

## Executed Checks

| ID | Check | Surface | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BK-32-TC-01 | Expanded view returns 4 ATCs inline | API | PASSED | HTTP 200; 4 ATCs with steps and assertions returned |
| BK-32-TC-02 | Position labels match saved execution order | API + DB | PASSED | positions=[1,2,3,4] |
| BK-32-TC-03 | Expanded view reflects latest saved ATC content | API + DB | PASSED | ATC-B changed from 1 step/1 assertion to 2 steps/2 assertions and GET reflected it |
| BK-32-TC-04 | ATC with empty assertions renders clear section state | API | PASSED | API returns empty array, not null |
| BK-32-TC-05 | Cross-workspace Test access denied without leakage | API + Security | PASSED | HTTP 404 not_found for foreign workspace Test |
| BK-32-TC-05b | Missing Test shows safe not-found state | API + Security | PASSED | HTTP 404 not_found for non-existent UUID |
| BK-32-TC-06 | Read-only contract blocks mutation methods | API | PASSED | POST, DELETE, and PATCH return 405 Method Not Allowed |
| BK-32-TC-07 | 7-ATC expanded read meets performance target | API + Performance | PASSED | 271ms warm; target less than 500ms |
| BK-32-TC-08 | Long steps and assertions remain readable in response | API + UX data | PASSED | 500-character step and 500-character assertion returned intact |

## Test Data

| Entity | ID / Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4-ATC Test | e72c88da-4cd3-4726-8bc2-1ffb02c3327b | Main expanded-read verification |
| 7-ATC Test | d926d94d-0521-436e-a030-cc8ed371ce15 | Performance check; 271ms warm |
| Long-content Test | ac7a3b82-6b20-4b81-96cb-f39ad5492e8e | 500-character step and assertion |
| Cross-workspace Test | 7b14c384 | Old workspace a222895a; returns 404 |
| Active workspace | d8aec050-72cc-4229-9d3e-56c120b2fafa | Owner role for final execution |

## Contract Validation

| Contract | Expected | Observed | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expanded read | Test header + ordered ATC chain + steps + assertions | Returned in one GET response | PASSED |
| Live content | Latest ATC edit appears on Test GET | ATC-B edit reflected immediately | PASSED |
| Non-disclosure | Missing and foreign Tests should not expose existence | Both returned 404 not_found | PASSED |
| Read-only surface | No mutation through this endpoint | POST/DELETE/PATCH returned 405 | PASSED |
| Performance | 7-ATC read under 500ms target | 271ms warm | PASSED |

## Expert Panel Review

| Role | Finding | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| QA Lead | Coverage validates all executable BK-32 behaviors after ATC-05 was dropped. | Accept sprint-testing result as complete for current implementation. |
| Technical Architect | Single expanded read avoids N+1 behavior and matches the intended read-only contract. | Keep performance and payload shape in regression candidates. |
| Security/AppSec | Non-disclosing 404 for missing and foreign Tests is the correct read-side security posture. | Preserve this behavior and avoid replacing it with existence-revealing 403. |
| Senior Developer | Accept-and-ignore expand parameter is acceptable for MVP because only full expansion is consumed. | Document as MVP behavior and revisit only if partial expansion has a user need. |
| Skeptical Reviewer | The only remaining issue is stale requirements text around zero-ATC state, not execution evidence. | Do not rerun; clean canonical AC/story text separately. |

## Bugs Found

None confirmed.

## Observations

- GET /api/v1/tests/{id} accepts the expand parameter but always returns fully expanded content in MVP.
- Live content is confirmed; existing expanded Test reads do not snapshot ATC content.
- Missing, not-visible, and foreign-workspace Tests all return non-disclosing 404.
- The composed read uses one RPC-style response for Test, ATCs, steps, and assertions.
- Token expired mid-session; execution was resumed and completed with backup user openapi_testing@xenievzoau.resend.app.

## Deferred Follow-Up Coverage

| Follow-up | Reason | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Remove or reconcile zero-ATC scenario | Dev decision dropped BK-32-ATC-05 because BK-27 requires at least one ATC. | PO / Dev |
| Regression automation for expanded payload | Core user value and contract shape. | Automation |
| Regression automation for cross-workspace 404 | High security value. | Automation |
| Regression automation for 7-ATC performance | Protects no-N+1 behavior. | Automation |

## Recommendation

QA approves BK-32 for the sprint scope as PASSED. No blocking defect was found. Move selected expanded-read, live-content, security, and performance checks to Stage 4 ROI/regression documentation.

# QA Testing Complete - BK-32

Environment: Staging
Result: PASSED WITH SCOPE NOTE (9/9 executed checks passed; ATC-05 dropped per Dev decision Section 3.1)

## Test Data Used

- Workspace: BK-32 Sprint QA (`d8aec050-72cc-4229-9d3e-56c120b2fafa`, owner role)
- 4-ATC Test: BK-32 4-ATC Test (`e72c88da-4cd3-4726-8bc2-1ffb02c3327b`)
- 7-ATC Test: BK-32 Perf 7-ATC Test (`d926d94d-0521-436e-a030-cc8ed371ce15`)
- Long-content Test: BK-32 Long Content Test (`ac7a3b82-6b20-4b81-96cb-f39ad5492e8e`)
- Cross-workspace Test: old workspace `a222895a`; read returns 404 without existence leak
- Backup execution user: `openapi_testing@xenievzoau.resend.app`

## Verified Behaviors

- AC1: Expanded Test view returns ATCs inline in saved execution order - VERIFIED
- AC2: Position labels match the persisted ATC chain order - VERIFIED
- AC3: Edited ATC content appears live in expanded reads, not as a stale snapshot - VERIFIED
- AC4: ATC with zero assertions renders a clear empty assertions state - VERIFIED
- AC5: Cross-workspace Test access is denied without information leakage using 404 `not_found` - VERIFIED
- AC6: Missing Test shows a safe not-found state using 404 `not_found` - VERIFIED
- AC7: Edit, add, remove, and reorder controls are not available through the read-only endpoint; mutation methods return 405 - VERIFIED
- AC8: 7-ATC expanded read meets the p95 target with a 271ms warm response under the 500ms target - VERIFIED
- AC9: Long steps and assertions remain readable with 500-character content preserved - VERIFIED

## Open Non-Blocking Risks

- ATC-05 zero-ATC empty state remains intentionally dropped because BK-27 requires at least one ATC; PO/Dev should remove or reconcile the stale zero-ATC requirement text.
- The `expand` parameter is accepted but ignored in MVP because the endpoint always returns the full expanded payload.
- Expanded-read payload, cross-workspace 404, 7-ATC performance, and long-content readability should be promoted to Stage 4 ROI/regression documentation.

## Evidence

- ATR evidence: `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-BK-24-tests-chains-of-atcs/stories/STORY-BK-32-tms-test-view-view-a-test-with-all-chained-atcs-ex/acceptance-test-results.md`
- Session memory: `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-BK-24-tests-chains-of-atcs/stories/STORY-BK-32-tms-test-view-view-a-test-with-all-chained-atcs-ex/test-session-memory.md`
- Jira fallback ATR comment: BK-32 comment `11728`

QA sign-off: approved with non-blocking follow-up risks.

# Expert Panel Review - Sprint Testing Audit BK-32

> ***SUCCESS:***  Sprint-testing package accepted. No execution rerun needed.

## Executive Summary

The expert panel reviewed BK-32 after the Jira report formatting correction. The sprint-testing outcome is valid: 9 executable scenarios passed, 0 failed, 0 deferred, and 0 bugs. The current Jira reporting shape is now acceptable because the detailed ATR and compact QA verdict are separate comments and no longer rely on broken Markdown tables.

## Evidence Used

- Jira: BK-32 story is QA Approved and contains the final `BK-32 TEST RESULTS` comment plus separate `QA Testing Complete - BK-32` verdict comment.
- Jira: The final report records staging execution, test data IDs, endpoint behavior, non-disclosure 404 behavior, performance result, and no defects.
- Engram: Prior learning #310 confirmed Markdown pipe tables rendered poorly in Jira and required plain-text or native ADF tables.
- Repo/local cache: `acceptance-test-results.md` confirms smoke GO, 9 passed, 0 failed, 0 deferred, 0 bugs.

## Expert Findings

- QA Lead: Coverage is sufficient for the implemented contract. It includes expanded read, order integrity, live content, boundary empty child arrays, safe not-found, cross-workspace denial, read-only mutation methods, performance, and long content.
- Technical Architect: Implementation evidence is coherent with a single expanded read contract: `GET /api/v1/tests/{id}` returns Test header, ordered ATC chain, steps, and assertions in one response.
- Security/AppSec: Cross-workspace and missing Test behavior uses non-disclosing 404. This is stronger than exposing a forbidden/not-found distinction.
- Senior Developer: The `expand` query being accepted and ignored is acceptable for MVP because the only consumer needs fully expanded content. Documenting this prevents future confusion.
- Workflow/Jira: Report format is fixed. ATR and QA verdict are separated and readable. This should remain the sprint-testing reporting pattern for Jira-native mode.
- Skeptical Reviewer: Main residual risk is not execution quality. It is stale requirements text: historical shift-left content still references zero-ATC behavior, while the Dev plan dropped BK-32-ATC-05 because BK-27 requires at least one ATC.

## Report Improvements Added

- Added this expert audit note as the review closure layer, without duplicating the full ATR.
- Explicitly records that the corrected report format is accepted.
- Explicitly records that no rerun is needed.
- Clarifies that BK-32-ATC-05 is intentionally dropped, not deferred or untested.
- Calls out follow-up requirement cleanup separately from QA execution status.

## Residual Follow-Up

> ***WARNING:*** Requirements cleanup recommended, not a QA blocker for this sprint-testing result.

- PO/Dev should remove or reconcile the zero-ATC scenario from canonical AC/story text because the implementation decision dropped it.
- If the Acceptance Criteria field is later updated, keep the executable set aligned with the final 9 verified behaviors.
- Stage 4/test-documentation should prioritize regression candidates for expanded read, live content, cross-workspace denial, and 7-ATC performance.

## Panel Verdict

VERDICT: ACCEPTED

BK-32 sprint-testing is well developed and report quality is now sufficient for audit/read-back. Remaining action is requirements cleanup, not additional execution.
