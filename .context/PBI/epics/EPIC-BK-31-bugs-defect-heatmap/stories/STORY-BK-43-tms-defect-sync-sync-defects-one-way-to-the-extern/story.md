## Overview

***Source spec:*** BK-028

## User story

***As a*** QA Lead
***I want to*** have defects filed in Bunkai sync automatically and one-way to the team's external tracker
***So that*** engineering can pick the work up in the tool they already use, with a link back to the full context in Bunkai

## Definition of done

- [ ] A defect filed in Bunkai is sent to the external tracker automatically when the integration is enabled
- [ ] The synced item in the external tracker links back to the original defect in Bunkai
- [ ] Filing a defect never waits on or fails because of the sync
- [ ] A defect whose sync succeeds shows a clear synced state with a way to open it in the external tracker
- [ ] A defect whose sync fails is marked sync-failed and remains fully usable in Bunkai
- [ ] A sync-failed defect is retried later without the Lead doing anything
- [ ] Sync sends defects in one direction only — Bunkai to the external tracker, never the reverse
