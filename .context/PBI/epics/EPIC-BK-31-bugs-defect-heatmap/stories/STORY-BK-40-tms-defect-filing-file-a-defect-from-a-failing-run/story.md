## Overview

# BK-40: TMS-Defect Filing | File a defect from a failing run step

## Metadata Snapshot

- ***Jira key***: BK-40
- ***Status***: 
- ***Source spec***: BK-025
- ***Parent epic/module***: BK Test Repository / TMS Defect Filing
- ***Last updated***: 2026-06-17 shift-left formatting correction

## User Story

As a QA Engineer, I want to file a defect directly from a failing step during a run, with the module, severity, steps-to-reproduce and evidence already filled in from the run context, so that the defect is captured in the moment without me retyping anything I just saw.

## Source & Evidence

- ***Source spec***: BK-025
- ***Evidence used***: BK-40 Jira fields, BK-40 previous shift-left package, BK-39 formatting reference, BK-91 ADF formatter capability reference, expert-panel-review findings.
- ***Evidence labels used***: Jira, Repo, Engram, Inference.

## Original Definition of Done

- ***Report defect action***: appears when a step is marked failed during a run.
- ***Pre-filled defect form***: includes module, executed steps, failing ATC, and captured evidence.
- ***Severity***: can be set to `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, or `P4` before saving.
- ***Standalone filing***: defects can also be filed outside a run from the defects area.
- ***Title validation***: title length is validated from 5 to 200 characters with a clear message when out of range.
- ***Module validation***: module is required and only modules belonging to the current project can be chosen.
- ***Evidence limit***: up to 10 evidence links can be attached; attempting more is blocked with a clear message.
- ***Initial visibility***: filed defect starts in `open` state and is immediately visible in the defects list.

## QA Refinements (Shift-Left Analysis)

Added 2026-06-17 by Shift-Left QA. Full refined ACs live in `✅ Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)` when the field accepts updates; ATP DRAFT lives in `🧪 Acceptance Test Plan (ATP)` when the field accepts updates. Fallback comments are used only if custom-field publishing is blocked.

### Expert-panel decisions

| Decision | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Primary entry path | `Report defect` appears only for failed run steps. |
| Secondary entry path | Standalone defect filing from defects area remains in scope. |
| Defect contract | One TMS-native defect creation contract supports optional run context. |
| Run-linked context | Run, step, ATC, module, executed steps, and evidence references are preserved from the failed-step context. |
| Editable context | User can edit title, severity, reproduction text, and evidence list; run/step/ATC linkage stays non-editable. |
| Permission | Active current-project member with write access can file defects; read-only users cannot. |
| Evidence | Evidence links/references only; file upload is out of scope. |
| Jira sync | Out of scope for BK-40; delegated to downstream sync work. |

### Scope summary

In scope: run-linked defect filing from failed step, standalone defect filing, severity P1/P2/P3/P4, title length validation, current-project module validation, max 10 evidence links, initial `open` state, immediate visibility in defects list.

Out of scope: marking a step failed, defect lifecycle beyond initial `open`, Jira sync/export, file upload evidence, formal test-case creation, automated test implementation.

### Readiness

Ready for estimation after expert-panel refinement. QA recommends 5 SP with confidence 0.82. Re-estimate if Jira sync, file upload, blocked/skipped-step filing, expanded permissions, or BK-35 failed-step contract changes enter scope.
