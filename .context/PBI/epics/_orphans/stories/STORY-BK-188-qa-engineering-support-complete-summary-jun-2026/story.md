### Automated tests (12/12 TC outlines covered)

{panel:bgColor=#E8F5E9}
***Framework******:*** Playwright + TypeScript + KATA architecture
***Project******:*** bunkai-qa-engineering (separate QA repo)
***CI/CD******:*** GitHub Actions — build.yml (PR gate), regression.yml (nightly), sanity.yml (manual), smoke.yml (daily)
***Reporting******:*** Allure reports deployed to GitHub Pages
***Reports URL******:*** https://nelgoez.github.io/bunkai-qa-engineering/staging/sanity/
{panel}

All 18 tests pass in CI. They use a Personal Access Token (PAT) for API auth, bypassing the broken /auth/login endpoint (BK-177 REJECTED).

### Known blocks / gaps

| Issue | Blocked on | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BK-150: 403 scope test | STAGING*USER*READONLY_PAT — need a token without atc:write scope | Medium |
| Tests not in `integration` project | BK-177 — /auth/login REJECTED, can't use api-setup dependency | Low |
| Sandbox tests not in nightly regression yet | Currently only in build.yml (PR) and sanity.yml (manual) | Low |
| Allure gh-pages first-deploy git error | No history branch; self-heals after first successful deploy | Cosmetic |

### CI/CD pipeline status

| Workflow | Trigger | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| build.yml | PR to main | Compile + lint + sandbox tests |
| regression.yml | Daily midnight + manual | Integration (broken — BK-177) → E2E → Allure |
| smoke.yml | Daily 2AM + manual | @critical tests → Allure |
| sanity.yml | Manual dispatch | Targeted execution, supports sandbox project |

### Recommendations

1. Fix BK-177 (/auth/login) to unblock `integration` project and enable full regression suite
2. Create a restricted-scope PAT to test BK-150 403 scenario
3. Add sandbox tests to nightly regression.yml once CI credentials are stable
4. Set up cross-repo CI trigger: app repo deploy → QA repo test run
