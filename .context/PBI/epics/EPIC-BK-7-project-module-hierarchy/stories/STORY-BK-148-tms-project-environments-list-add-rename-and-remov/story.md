## Overview

***Source spec******:*** FR-005

## User story

As a Senior QA Engineer, I want to manage the list of environments for a project (list, add, rename, and remove) so that I can keep the run targets accurate and start manual runs against the right environment.

## Definition of done

- A project member can open the project's environment list and see every environment for that project.
- A project member can add, rename, and remove an environment, with the uniqueness and trimming rules enforced.
- Removing an environment that a Run already references is handled safely per the agreed business rule (default: blocked, with a clear message).
- The happy-path, validation, and guard scenarios in the Acceptance Criteria are demonstrably met on staging.
- Acceptance criteria validated; no critical or major defects open.
