Merged to staging via PR #43 (https://github.com/upex-galaxy/upex-bunkai-tms/pull/43). Deployed to https://staging-upexbunkai.vercel.app — ready for QA.

***Scope delivered******:*** persistent project explorer + toolbar on every project route; ATCs and Tests open as route-driven workbench tabs (multi-tab, dedup, close→adjacent, close-last→index); deep-link opens an item as a tab; safe in-shell not-found for deleted/invisible items; app-shell search wired to ⌘K palette.

All 10 acceptance scenarios validated live on the "Rocket" project; quality gates green (types/lint/tests). Bundled fix: BK-28 Test-detail hydration mismatch.

@Ely ready for QA verification on staging.

## BK-147 — QA Report

Tested: 2026-06-23 · Environment: Staging · Result: PASSED (4/11) · BLOCKED (7/11 — data gap)

App shell verified: persistent sidebar, account block, workspace switcher, global search, breadcrumb navigation, toolbar (New ATC/Test), workbench index state all working correctly.

Tab behavior (open, multi-tab, close, deep-link, not-found, cross-project isolation) could not be fully exercised — no modules/ATCs/Tests exist in the qa-headless workspace to open as tabs. Requires test data seeding.
