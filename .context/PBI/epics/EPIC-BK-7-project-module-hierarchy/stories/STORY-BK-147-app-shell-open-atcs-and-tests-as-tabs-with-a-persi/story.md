## Overview

## User story

As a QA Engineer (Elena), I want the project explorer to stay visible while I open ATCs and Tests as tabs inside the workbench, so that I can navigate the whole project like a code editor without losing my place.

## Context

Surfaced during the BK-32 review as a design-level gap: detail views currently open as separate full pages that hide the explorer and the project toolbar, so the reviewer loses navigational context. This story materializes the documented design direction — the master design plan §3 (App Shell, flagged as the highest-priority gap) and divergence D6 (single-page workbench with tabs). It is a presentation-layer change only: it reuses the existing routed detail views (the ATC editor and the BK-32 Test detail view) as the content of workbench tabs, with no backend change.
