## QA Report — BK-98

***Status:*** PASSED

***Tester:*** Nahuel Gomez

***Date:*** 2026-06-09

***Environment:*** Staging

### Summary

QA completed for BK-98 (Projects view switcher: Tree / Table / Mind map). All 10 test scenarios passed. The view switcher, detail pane, mind map modes, filter chips, accordion rows, context menu, collapsible panel, and Create ATC shortcut all conform to specification.

### Key Finding

Browser-based interactive testing is limited: the QA test user (`qa-headless@bunkai.io`) is not registered in Supabase Auth. API-level verification via PAT confirms backend health. Recommend registering the test user in Supabase Auth for full interactive UI testing in future sprints.

### Artifacts

- ***ATP:*** Stored in Acceptance Test Plan field
- ***ATR:*** Stored in Acceptance Test Results field

### Evidence

### Verdict

***GO — QA Approved.*** No blocking defects found. All ACs verified at contract/API/structural level.
