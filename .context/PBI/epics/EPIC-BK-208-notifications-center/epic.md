**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Planning
**Total Story Points:** 0

## Description

Bunkai already records everything that matters — runs finish, bugs land on people, statuses move — but today the only way to learn any of it is to go looking. This epic makes workspace events reach the right person without polling: Elena learns her run finished without keeping the run tab open, Sara learns a bug was assigned to her while she is still in her editor flow, and Mateo gets a daily digest instead of touring dashboards every morning.

***Scope boundary.**** This epic delivers an ****in-app notification inbox**** (bell + panel), ****event subscriptions for the run and bug lifecycles****, ****per-event-type notification preferences****, and an ****email digest of unread items***. It does NOT deliver chat or direct messages (that is the future Team Chat epic — its mentions will land in this same inbox) and it does NOT deliver external integrations such as Slack or webhook delivery (future integrations work).

## User Stories

| # | Story | Persona |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BK-209 | Notifications | View an inbox of workspace events | Elena Vargas, Senior QA Engineer |
| BK-211 | Notifications | Get notified when a run finishes or is aborted | Elena Vargas, Senior QA Engineer |
| BK-212 | Notifications | Get notified on bug assignment and status changes | Sara Iglesias, Full-Stack Developer |
| BK-213 | Notifications | Configure notification preferences per event type | Elena Vargas, Senior QA Engineer |
| BK-214 | Notifications | Receive an email digest of unread notifications | Mateo Silva, QA Lead |

## Traceability

- Consumes lifecycle events from epic ***BK-30 Manual Execution & Runs**** (final verdicts and aborts) and from epic ****BK-31 Bugs & Defect Heatmap*** (assignment and status changes).
- Notification preferences live as a sub-view of the ***Settings hub delivered by BK-87*** (epic BK-85 Account & Settings).
- Future ***Team Chat*** mentions are a declared event type from day one (visible but locked in preferences), so chat work later plugs into this inbox instead of building a second delivery surface.
