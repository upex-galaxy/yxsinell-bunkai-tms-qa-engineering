## Overview

## User story

As Elena Vargas, Senior QA Engineer, I want to be notified when a run I started reaches a final verdict or is aborted, so that I learn the outcome the moment it lands instead of keeping the run open or revisiting run history.

## Context

Runs already end in exactly two final verdicts — passed or failed — or get aborted with a reason. When someone else finishes the work (a teammate picking up her run, an AI agent, or CI acting as executor), Elena currently finds out only by checking. This story subscribes the run starter to those terminal events and delivers them into the notification inbox. It activates once the inbox (sibling story) is live; the run lifecycle it listens to already ships with epic BK-30 Manual Execution & Runs.
