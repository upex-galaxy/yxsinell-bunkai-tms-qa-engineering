## Overview

## User story

As ***Elena Vargas, Senior QA Engineer***, I want the runs views to distinguish manual from automated execution with a visible badge and a filter, so that I can tell at a glance what the team ran by hand versus what the automation reported — and answer coverage questions per mode.

## Context

The runs views already exist: each Test has a run history filterable by outcome, and the project runs view shows pass/fail totals with filters. Once agents and CI pipelines start reporting runs, those lists mix human and machine executions — and the mix is invisible. This story makes execution mode a first-class, visible, filterable dimension: a mode badge on every run row, an execution-mode filter that composes with the existing filters, and totals split per mode.

This story activates when its dependencies are live: it extends the project runs reporting view and the run history view from the Manual Execution & Runs epic, and it becomes genuinely useful once the sibling ingestion stories (API submission, streaming, CI upload) start producing automated runs.
