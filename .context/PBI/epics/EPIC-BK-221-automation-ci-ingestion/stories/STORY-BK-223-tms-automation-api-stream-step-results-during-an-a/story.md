## Overview

## User story

As ***Karim, an Autonomous AI Test Agent***, I want to start a run, report step results one by one in near-real-time, and finish it with a verdict, so that humans watching the run view see progress live and an interrupted run leaves an honest partial record instead of silence.

## Context

The single-call submission story covers "the run already happened". Streaming covers "the run is happening now": Karim opens a Run against an existing Test, pushes each step result as he executes it, and closes the run with a verdict — mirroring the manual flow where a QA engineer marks steps one by one and finishes with a verdict. Anyone with the run detail open sees steps flip in near-real-time. This is the write-back primitive Karim never gets from other tools: read a test, execute it, stream state back.

This story activates when its dependencies are live: it builds on the run lifecycle from the Manual Execution & Runs epic (start, per-step statuses, finish verdict, abort with reason), workspace Personal Access Tokens from Settings, and the auth/idempotency contract established by the sibling single-call submission story.
