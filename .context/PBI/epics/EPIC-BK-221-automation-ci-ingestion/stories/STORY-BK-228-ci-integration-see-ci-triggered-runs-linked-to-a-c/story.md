## Overview

## User story

As ***Sara Iglesias, Full-Stack Developer***, I want CI-triggered runs to carry commit, branch, and pipeline metadata and to jump from a run to the commit it tested, so that I can answer "did my change break a test?" from the PR context without spelunking through CI logs.

## Context

Automated runs enter Bunkai through API submission, streaming, or CI file upload. When the trigger is a pipeline, the most valuable context is **which change was under test**: the commit reference, the branch, and the pipeline that ran. This story attaches that metadata to automated runs, shows it in the run detail and runs views, makes branch a searchable dimension, and links the commit reference out to the repository host. It is the bridge between Bunkai's run history and Sara's PR-centric world.

This story activates when its dependencies are live: the ingestion paths from the sibling stories (submission, streaming, upload) accept the optional CI metadata this story displays.
