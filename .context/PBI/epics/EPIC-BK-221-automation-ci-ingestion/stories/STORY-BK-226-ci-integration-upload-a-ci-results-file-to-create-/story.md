## Overview

## User story

As ***Sara Iglesias, Full-Stack Developer***, I want to upload a standard CI results report (e.g. JUnit XML) and have it mapped onto an existing Test, so that pipeline results become a Bunkai run without me writing an API client.

## Context

Not every team scripts against an API — but nearly every CI tool emits a standard results file, with JUnit XML as the de facto interchange format. This story opens a file-shaped door into run ingestion: pick a Test and an environment, upload the report, review a mapping preview showing how report entries line up with the Test's steps, confirm, and a finished automated run is created. Unmapped entries are clearly surfaced and acknowledged, never silently dropped — silent data loss is exactly what makes teams distrust QA tooling.

This story activates when its dependencies are live: it builds on the run ingestion contract from the sibling submission story, the Tests library, and Personal Access Tokens for the scripted (non-interactive) upload path.
