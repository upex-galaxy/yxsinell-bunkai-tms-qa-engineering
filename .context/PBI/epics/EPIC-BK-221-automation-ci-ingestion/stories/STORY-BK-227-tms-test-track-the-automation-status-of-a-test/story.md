## Overview

## User story

As ***Elena Vargas, Senior QA Engineer***, I want to mark each Test as manual-only, automation candidate, or automated — and see and filter that status in the test library — so that the team always knows what is automated, what is next in line, and what will stay manual.

## Context

Tests in Bunkai already have tags and a library view. What they lack is an explicit automation lifecycle answer: "is this automated, should it be, or will it stay manual?" Today that answer lives in heads and spreadsheets. This story adds a first-class automation status to the Test — three values, a badge, a filter, per-status counts — with a preserved history of who changed it and when, so status changes are accountable, not folklore.

This story activates when its dependencies are live: it extends the test library from the Tests epic and complements the execution-mode reporting story — automation status describes the Test's intent, while execution mode describes how a given run actually happened.
