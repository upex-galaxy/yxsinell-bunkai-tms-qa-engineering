## Overview

## User story

As ***Karim, an Autonomous AI Test Agent*** acting on behalf of the QA team, I want to submit a completed automated execution of an existing Test in a single API call — per-step results, final verdict, duration, environment, and evidence references — so that the run appears in Bunkai exactly like a manual run, without a human re-typing automation results.

## Context

Bunkai already records manual Runs end to end: a Run executes a Test (an ordered chain of ATCs) against a Project Environment, each step is marked pass, fail, or block, and the run finishes with a passed or failed verdict (or is aborted). This story opens that same run record to machines: an agent or script that has already executed a Test elsewhere reports the outcome in one call, and the resulting Run is browsable in run history and the project runs view like any other. Retries must be safe — Karim's core pain is that resubmitting after a timeout doubles run state in most tools, so idempotent resubmission is part of the contract.

This story activates when its dependencies are live: it builds on the Run lifecycle shipped by the Manual Execution & Runs epic, the Tests library, and workspace Personal Access Tokens from Settings. Runs submitted this way feed the execution-mode reporting and CI stories of this epic.
