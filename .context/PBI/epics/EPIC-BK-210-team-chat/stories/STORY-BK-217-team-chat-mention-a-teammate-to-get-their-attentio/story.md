## Overview

## User story

As Sara Iglesias, a Full-Stack Developer, I want to mention a teammate in a chat message, so that the right person gets pulled into the conversation without me chasing them in another tool.

## Context

A message in a busy channel is easy to miss; a mention is a direct tap on the shoulder. This story adds @-mentions with autocomplete from the workspace member list, renders mentions highlighted in the message, and — because the Notifications Center epic is live — delivers a notification to the mentioned member's notifications inbox. It composes with the Notifications Center rather than inventing its own delivery: chat produces the mention event, the notifications inbox carries it to the member. It activates once the workspace channel story and the Notifications Center inbox are both live.
