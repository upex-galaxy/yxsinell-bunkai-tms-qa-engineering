## Overview

***Source spec:*** FR-004 — Workspace switch

## User story

As an authenticated user, I want to switch between Workspaces I belong to so that I can serve multiple clients or teams from one Bunkai account.

Implements ***FR-004***.

## Business rules

- User MUST be an active member of the target workspace (`status = "active"`); suspended or removed members get 403.
- The session's `active*workspace*id` MUST be the single source of truth for tenancy scoping in API middleware.
- Switching does NOT invalidate the session; only the scope changes.
- All subsequent API responses MUST reflect data scoped to the new active workspace.

## Workflow

1. User clicks the workspace switcher in the header.
2. Dropdown shows the list from `GET /api/v1/me/workspaces`.
3. User clicks Workspace B.
4. UI POSTs `/api/v1/me/active-workspace` with {{{ workspace_id: "B" }}}.
5. Server validates membership + status.
6. Server rotates session's `active*workspace*id`.
7. Returns 200 with the new workspace context.
8. UI navigates to `/home` (Workspace B's home).
9. All subsequent requests carry the new context.

## Definition of done
