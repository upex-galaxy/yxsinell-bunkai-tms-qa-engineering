## Overview

***Source spec:*** FR-003 — Invite teammate

## User story

As a Workspace `owner` or `admin`, I want to invite a teammate by email and assign them a role (`owner` / `admin` / `member` / `viewer`) so that access is controlled.

Implements ***FR-003***.

## Business rules

- Caller's role MUST be `admin` or higher to create an invite.
- Invited role MUST be less than or equal to caller's role (`admin` cannot invite an `owner`).
- `email` MUST be unique among active workspace members.
- Invite token: HMAC-signed; includes `workspace_id` + `email` + `role` + expiry; single-use.
- Acceptance is idempotent: re-clicking an accepted invite returns 200 with current membership, not a new row.

## Workflow

***Inviter***

1. Owner or admin clicks "Invite teammate".
2. UI shows email + role dropdown (filtered to ≤ caller's role).
3. `POST /api/v1/workspaces/{id}/invites` with {{{ email, role }}}.
4. Server validates caller role + role-hierarchy + uniqueness.
5. Server generates signed token + inserts `workspace_invites` row.
6. Server dispatches email with link `/accept-invite?token=...`.
7. Returns 201.

***Invitee***

1. Receives email, clicks link.
2. If not signed in: lands on `/login`, then redirected back to `/accept-invite?token=...`.
3. `POST /api/v1/invites/{token}/accept`.
4. Server validates token signature + expiry + email-match.
5. Inserts `workspace_members` row with role from token.
6. Marks invite accepted.
7. Redirects to `/home`.
