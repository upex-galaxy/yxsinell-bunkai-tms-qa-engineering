## Overview

***Source spec:*** FR-001 — Email + OAuth sign-up (OAuth portion)

## User story

As a visitor, I want to sign up and sign in via OAuth (GitHub or Google) so that I can join Bunkai using my existing identity provider.

Implements ***FR-001**** partially — OAuth side only. Email magic-link is covered by ****BK-2***.

## Business rules

- OAuth state token MUST be validated server-side; mismatch → 403.
- An OAuth-only user has NO password and cannot use email magic-link as alternate sign-in unless explicitly linked (Phase 2).
- If a user signs up with both GitHub and Google using the same verified email, the second attempt is rejected with `EMAIL_EXISTS` (manual linking by support in MVP).

## Workflow

1. Visitor clicks "Continue with GitHub" (or Google).
2. Browser is redirected to provider's consent screen with state token attached.
3. User approves on provider.
4. Provider redirects to `/auth/callback?code=...&state=...`.
5. Server validates state, exchanges code with Supabase Auth.
6. On success: user row created or upserted with `provider` field; if first verified login, default workspace created; session cookie set.
7. Redirect to `/home`.
8. On any failure: redirect to `/login` with error code + magic-link fallback CTA.

## Definition of done

- Implementation complete
- Unit tests written
- Code reviewed
- Documentation updated

## QA Refinements (Shift-Left Analysis)

***Refined on****: 2026-05-26 | ****QA mode***: Shift-Left pre-sprint batch  
***Verdict***: Needs Improvement — 7 AC gaps, 5 ambiguities, 2 contradictions found

---

### Story Quality Summary

| Axis  | Rating  |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- |
| Business logic  | High  |
| Integration complexity  | High  |
| Data validation  | Medium  |
| UI complexity  | Low  |

***Test effort estimate***: High — 20 test outlines (5 positive, 7 negative, 3 boundary, 5 integration)

---

### Critical Implementation Gap

***OAuth buttons in**** `login/page.tsx` ****are hardcoded as*** `disabled` (label "soon", `cursor-not-allowed`, `opacity-60`). BK-3 cannot be tested until these buttons are enabled as part of this story's implementation scope.

---

### Ambiguities Found (5)

|  | Question  | Impact  |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A1  | Who validates OAuth state token — Supabase SDK or custom middleware?  | Scope of state-tampering test  |
| A2  | Is `provider` upserted to `auth.users.raw*app*meta_data` or a separate Bunkai table?  | Determines DB assertions  |
| A3  | Is first-login workspace bootstrap synchronous (rollback on fail) or fire-and-forget?  | Two different test paths  |
| A4  | Canonical post-OAuth redirect: `/home` (story) vs `/projects` (code)?  | Success-path assertion target  |
| A5  | Is magic-link fallback CTA always visible or dynamically rendered on error?  | CTA visibility assertion  |

---

### AC Gaps Found (7)

|  | Missing AC  | Risk if omitted  |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1  | State token mismatch → 403 + redirect to `/login?error=state_mismatch`  | CSRF/session fixation — pre-release checklist item #1  |
| G2  | Provider returns error param (user denies consent) → graceful error redirect  | Callback crashes with 500  |
| G3  | Workspace bootstrap fails after token exchange → session NOT set  | Ghost user: valid JWT, no workspace, all API calls 403  |
| G4  | Returning user (not first login) → no duplicate workspace created  | Workspace duplication on every sign-in  |
| G5  | OAuth redirect URI must be documented in spec or `.env.example`  | Misconfigured OAuth app = all sign-ins fail silently  |
| G6  | `EMAIL_EXISTS`: HTTP status, user-visible message, error URL not specified  | Silent failure or account-existence information leak  |
| G7  | Rate-limit policy for OAuth initiation not specified  | Credential-stuffing via OAuth provider  |

---

### Contradictions Found (2)

|  | Contradiction  |
| --- |
| --- | --- |
| C1  | Story workflow says redirect to `/home`; callback route code defaults to `/projects`. Must reconcile before Dev implements.  |
| C2  | `login/page.tsx` comment says "OAuth ships next sprint" — if BK-3 is the OAuth ticket, UI copy AND button enable are in-scope.  |

---

### Critical Questions for PO (BLOCK sprint planning)

1. ***Canonical post-OAuth redirect***: `/home` or `/projects`? (C1)
2. `EMAIL_EXISTS` ***exact error code and user-visible message?*** (G6)
3. ***Invited users exempt from default workspace bootstrap?*** (E8 — prevents dual-workspace creation)
