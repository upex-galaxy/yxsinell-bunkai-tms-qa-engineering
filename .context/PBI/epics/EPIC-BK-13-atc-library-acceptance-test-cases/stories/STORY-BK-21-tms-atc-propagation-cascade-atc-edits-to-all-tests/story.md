## Overview

***Source spec:*** FR-012

## User story

***As a*** Senior QA Engineer
***I want to*** have my edits to an ATC reflected automatically in every Test that uses it
***So that*** maintaining shared components is a one-edit-many-tests operation and I never re-stitch tests by hand after a change.

## Definition of done

- [ ] Feature works end-to-end against staging
- [ ] Covered by an ATC chain anchored to a User Story + Acceptance Criterion
- [ ] Acceptance Criteria verified by QA
- [ ] Demoed to the team
