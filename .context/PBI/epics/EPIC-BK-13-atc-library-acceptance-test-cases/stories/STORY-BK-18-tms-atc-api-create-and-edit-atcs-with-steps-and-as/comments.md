1. 🧱 Architect Annotation

1. 

- DB tables touched: `atcs` (new row), `atc*steps` (bulk insert), `atc*assertions` (bulk insert). Both child tables FK to `atcs.id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Index `atc*steps(atc*id, position)` UNIQUE; `atc*assertions(atc*id, position)` UNIQUE.
- API surface: `POST /atcs` returns 201, `PATCH /atcs/{id}` returns 200. Validation errors return 422 with `{ error_code, fields[] }`. OpenAPI spec under `api/openapi.yaml` → `paths./atcs.post`, `paths./atcs/{id}.patch`. Run `bun run api:sync` after spec changes.
- Server-side transaction boundary: BEGIN → INSERT atcs → INSERT atc*steps (batch) → INSERT atc*assertions (batch) → UPDATE atcs SET slug = compute*slug(atc*id, module*id) → COMMIT. PATCH: BEGIN → SELECT FOR UPDATE → UPDATE atcs → DELETE atc*steps + atc_assertions → re-INSERT → COMMIT.
- Slug computation: `{module-slug}/atc-{atc_id padded to 6 digits}`. Slug is set once and never re-computed on rename.
- Event emission: `atc.created` (POST) and `atc.updated` (PATCH) published via the existing event bus on commit (after-commit hook). Payload includes the full ATC + steps + assertions; PATCH event additionally carries `affected*test*ids[]`.
- Cross-entity validation runs before the transaction opens (cheap reads to verify AC→US and module→project subtree). Avoids holding row locks during validation.

1. 

- Upstream: [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-13#icft=BK-13](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-13#icft=BK-13) (parent epic), and Wave 1 entities — User Stories (`user*stories` table), Acceptance Criteria (`acceptance*criteria` table), Modules (`modules` table) must already exist with the validation columns this story references.
- Downstream: [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-19#icft=BK-19](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-19#icft=BK-19) (UI form consumes this API), [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-20#icft=BK-20](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-20#icft=BK-20) (search reads from `atcs`), [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-21#icft=BK-21](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-21#icft=BK-21) (PATCH propagation extends this endpoint), [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-22#icft=BK-22](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-22#icft=BK-22) (usage report joins `test*steps` → `atcs`), [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-23#icft=BK-23](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-23#icft=BK-23) (duplicate reuses the create path), EPIC-BK-5 Tests (test*steps table references atc_id).
- External: PostgreSQL 15+ for `gen*random*uuid`/CTE features; internal event bus (existing module).

1. 

- [ ] DB migration creates `atcs`, `atc*steps`, `atc*assertions` (if not present) — applies and reverts cleanly
- [ ] OpenAPI updated for POST and PATCH; `bun run api:sync` passes with no diff
- [ ] Unit tests cover: happy create, happy patch, AC-outside-US, module-outside-subtree, invalid layer enum, non-monotonic step positions
- [ ] Integration tests verify transaction rollback when ANY step/assertion insert fails
- [ ] Lint + typecheck pass
- [ ] Manual smoke: `curl -X POST /atcs` succeeds with sample payload; `curl -X PATCH` returns version+1
- [ ] PR description references each AC by Gherkin scenario name
- [ ] Event payload schema documented in `.context/business/events.md` under `atc.created` and `atc.updated`

1. 

- PRD: `.context/PRD/mvp-scope.md` § EPIC-BK-004 (US 4.1, US 4.2)
- SRS: `.context/SRS/functional-specs.md` § FR-010
- Business map: `.context/business/business-data-map.md` § atcs / atc*steps / atc*assertions
- API contract: `.context/SRS/api-contracts.yaml` § paths./atcs and paths./atcs/{id}

# ATC create + edit REST API (POST/PATCH /atcs, transactional steps + assertions)

***Jira Key:*** [BK-18](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-18)
***Epic:*** [BK-13](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-13) (ATC Library (Acceptance Test Cases))
***Priority:*** Medium
***Story Points:*** -
***Status:*** Shift-Left QA

---

## User Story

******Source spec:**** FR-010a — ATC server surface (REST)

As an automation engineer or API consumer, I want a REST API to create and edit ATCs (Acceptance Test Cases) with their steps and assertions in a single transactional call, so that I can compose reusable test building blocks from CLI tools, scripts, and the UI client.

Implements ***FR-010a*** — server surface only. UI form is [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-19#icft=BK-19](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-19#icft=BK-19), downstream Test composition is EPIC-BK-5.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
Scenario: Create ATC with valid payload
Given an authenticated member of the workspace
And a User Story US-100 in module M-10 with acceptance criteria AC-1 and AC-2
When the user POSTs to /atcs with title "Login with valid email", module*id M-10, user*story*id US-100, acceptance*criterion_ids [AC-1], layer "UI", and 3 steps plus 2 assertions
Then the API returns 201 with the new ATC, its steps, and its assertions
And the slug is "{module-slug}/{atc-id-padded}"
And an atc.created event is emitted

Scenario: Reject ATC when acceptance criteria belong to a different user story
Given an authenticated member
And AC-9 belongs to user story US-200 (not US-100)
When the user POSTs /atcs with user*story*id US-100 and acceptance*criterion*ids [AC-9]
Then the API returns 422 with error code "ac*outside*user_story"
And no row is inserted in atcs, atc*steps, or atc*assertions

Scenario: Reject ATC when module is not in the user story's project subtree
Given a User Story US-100 belongs to project P-1
And module M-99 belongs to project P-2
When the user POSTs /atcs with user*story*id US-100 and module_id M-99
Then the API returns 422 with error code "module*outside*project_subtree"

Scenario: Step positions must be strictly increasing from 1
Given an authenticated member
When the user POSTs /atcs with steps positions [1, 3, 2]
Then the API returns 422 with error code "steps*position*invalid"
And the response body lists the offending positions

Scenario: PATCH /atcs/{id} updates fields and cascade-replaces steps and assertions atomically
Given an existing ATC at version 1 with 3 steps and 1 assertion
When the user PATCHes /atcs/{id} with a new title and a replacement steps array of 2 steps
Then the API returns 200 with version 2
And the old steps and assertions are deleted in the same transaction as the new inserts
And an atc.updated event is emitted with affected*test*ids
```

## QA Refinements (Shift-Left Analysis)

> Added 2026-05-27 by Shift-Left QA. Full ATP DRAFT lives in custom field 🧪 Acceptance Test Plan (ATP) and mirrored as a comment on this issue. This section captures the slices PO + Dev need before estimation.

### 🔍 Refined Acceptance Criteria — summary

***13 Gherkin scenarios produced*** (Happy 2 / Negative 7 / Boundary 2 / Integration 2). Key contract decisions:

|  | Decision  | Rationale  | Source  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --- | ---------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 1  | ***Slug format***: `{module-slug}/atc-{id-first-8-chars`} (lowercase UUID prefix)  | uuid prefix is deterministic (no sequence dependency), unique, and readable. 8 chars balances collision safety vs brevity. Matches architect recommendation on [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-2#icft=BK-2](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-2#icft=BK-2) comment.  | Senior DEV  |
| 2  | ***PATCH semantics***: Full-replace body (PUT-like), NOT partial merge. `ATCCreate` schema reused. Omitted fields are NOT preserved — they are cleared.  | Existing `bunkai*save*atc` RPC replaces children wholesale (no diff). Partial merge would require field-level tracking across 4 tables with no existing infra. If client wants partial, they GET→modify→PATCH.  | Senior DEV  |
| 3  | ***Version conflict***: Optimistic locking via `If-Match: <version>` header. No version in body. 409 on mismatch.  | Industry standard (RFC 7232). Prevents lost updates. The existing RPC unconditionally bumps version; the route handler checks the header before calling the RPC.  | Senior DEV  |
| 4  | ***Error codes***: Add `ac*outside*user*story`, `module*outside*project*subtree`, `steps*position*invalid`, `layer*invalid`, `slug*collision` to `API*ERROR*CODES` map. Wrapped via `ApiError('validation*failed', 422, { code: 'ac*outside*user*story' })`.  | The existing 422 flow in `withApiHandler` catches ZodError but NOT semantic validation errors. Semantic errors need explicit `ApiError` throws with domain-specific codes.  | Senior QA  |
| 5  | ***Auth***: `requireBearerToken` + `requireScope(ctx, 'atc:write')` on both endpoints. `atc:read` tokens are rejected with 403.  | Established pattern from tokens routes. Consistent with existing scope model.  | Senior QA  |
| 6  | `bunkai*create*atc` ***RPC***: CREATE path needs a NEW RPC that returns the new `atc*id` (unlike `bunkai*save*atc` which is void). Signature: `bunkai*create*atc(p*project*id, p*module*id, p*user*story*id, p*title, p*layer, p*tags, p*steps, p*assertions, p*ac*ids) returns uuid`.  | `bunkai*save*atc` takes `p*atc*id` (UPDATE only). INSERT needs a different signature — no pre-existing id, needs project*id for RLS + slug. Adding a `p*create*flag` parameter would create an ugly dual-path RPC. A dedicated RPC is cleaner.  | Senior DEV  |
| 7  | `affected*test*ids` ***(PATCH event)***: Query `test*steps` table joining `atc*id`. Empty array = event still fires (consumers filter by `affected*test*ids.length === 0` if they only care about dependency impact).  | The SRS shows `used*in` field on ATC response → `test*steps` links. This is the canonical source.  | Senior DEV  |
| 8  | ***PATCH**** `user*story*id` ****mutability***: Immutable on PATCH. If client sends `user*story*id`, it is silently ignored (or 422 if different). ACs are bound to the ATC's original user story.  | Re-assigning user*story*id would break AC validation (ACs belong to original US). Cascade re-validation is expensive and adds risk. The architect annotation confirms this.  | Senior PO + Senior DEV  |

### ⚠️ Edge Cases Identified

***14 edge cases catalogued*** (6 High, 5 Medium, 3 Low):

| Sev  | Edge Case  | Mitigation / Decision  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| 🔴 High  | POST with invalid PAT (malformed, expired, revoked)  | Auth middleware returns 401 `unauthorized` — already tested in tokens routes.  |
| 🔴 High  | POST with `atc:read` scope (insufficient)  | `requireScope` returns 403 `forbidden` — established pattern.  |
| 🔴 High  | PATCH to non-existent ATC id  | 404 `not_found` — same pattern as tokens.  |
| 🔴 High  | Concurrent PATCH — version conflict (two clients at version 1)  | First wins (200 v2), second gets 409 `conflict`.  |
| 🔴 High  | Slug collision (same project, same slug)  | DB UNIQUE `(project*id, slug)` constraint. INSERT raises unique violation → map to 409 `slug*collision`.  |
| 🔴 High  | POST with `module*id` belonging to different project than `user*story*id`  | AC3 covers the positive case. Reject with 422 `module*outside*project*subtree`.  |
| 🟡 Medium  | POST with empty `steps[]` array  | `ATCCreate` schema requires `minItems: 1`. Zod rejects → 422 `validation_failed`.  |
| 🟡 Medium  | POST with layer value outside enum `{UI, API, Unit`}  | Zod enum rejects → 422 `validation_failed`.  |
| 🟡 Medium  | POST with 11 tags (exceeds max 10)  | Zod `maxItems: 10` rejects → 422.  |
| 🟡 Medium  | PATCH with empty body (no fields changed)  | ***Decision***: Accept empty PATCH as no-op → 200 with same version (no bump). RPC not called.  | Senior DEV  |
| 🟡 Medium  | POST with `acceptance*criterion*ids` that are valid UUIDs but don't exist in DB  | 422 `ac*outside*user_story` (same code — the query returns empty for non-existent IDs too).  |
| 🟢 Low  | Title with Unicode/emoji  | Existing DB `text` type handles UTF-8. Zod string accepts it. No special handling needed.  |
| 🟢 Low  | Step content > 2KB  | Zod `maxLength: 2048` on step content.  |
| 🟢 Low  | POST with `acceptance*criterion*ids: []` (empty array)  | Zod `minItems: 1` rejects → 422.  |

### 📋 Clarified Business Rules

- ***Slug uniqueness***: DB-level UNIQUE `(project*id, slug)`. On collision → 409 `slug*collision`. ATCs in different projects can share slugs.
- ***Version semantics***: Monotonically increasing integer, per-ATC. POST starts at 1, PATCH increments by 1 (unless no-op).
- ***Optimistic locking***: `If-Match: <current_version>` header on PATCH. Absent = skip version check (lenient mode for simple clients). Present & mismatch = 409. The existing RPC unconditionally bumps version — the route handler checks the header first.
- ***Transactional boundary****: One DB transaction per POST/PATCH. Cross-entity validation (AC→US, module→project) runs ****before*** the transaction opens (read-only queries). Steps/assertions INSERT happens inside the transaction. On any failure → rollback, zero rows written.
- ***Event emission***: `atc.created` fires on POST commit. `atc.updated` fires on PATCH commit with `affected*test*ids[]` populated via `test_steps` join. Events are fire-and-forget (after-commit hook). If the event bus is down, the API response is still 200/201 — the event is logged for replay.
- ***RLS***: All table operations go through existing RLS policies (`authenticated` + workspace membership). The RPCs are `security invoker` so RLS evaluates as the API caller.
- ***idempotency***: Not required for MVP. POSTs are not idempotent by nature (each creates a new ATC). PATCH is idempotent (same payload = same result). If idempotency is needed later, add `Idempotency-Key` header — existing `IdempotencyKeySchema` in the codebase covers this.
- ***Soft-delete***: OUT of scope for [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-18#icft=BK-18](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-18#icft=BK-18). DELETE endpoint will be BK-? (future Story). Status field exists in schema but is not touched by POST/PATCH.
- `used*in` ***field in response***: OUT of scope for [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-18#icft=BK-18](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-18#icft=BK-18). The GET endpoint (BK-? future) will expand it. POST/PATCH responses return the ATC object without `used*in`.

### ❓ Open Questions for PO / Dev / Design

***For PO (3):***

1. ***Resend / duplicate slug handling****: If slug collision on POST (unlikely but possible with UUID-based slugs), should we auto-retry with a suffix or return 409 for client to rename? ****Decision (Senior PO)***: Return 409 `slug*collision` — client must pick a different `module*id` or the ATC title will produce a different slug. Auto-retry masks the collision and confuses consumers.
2. ***Event consumers****: Who consumes `atc.created` / `atc.updated` in MVP? Are there any downstream systems (audit log, webhook, Analytics) that depend on the event shape NOW vs later? ****Decision (Senior PO)***: MVP consumers = BK-20 (search index), BK-21 (PATCH propagation). Both are in Wave 2. Events can be logged to `event_log` table for now; no external webhook in MVP.
3. ***Scope naming****: Confirm scope name `atc:write` covers both POST and PATCH? Or need separate `atc:create` and `atc:update`? ****Decision (Senior PO)***: Single `atc:write` for both. Granular scopes can be split later if audit requirements demand it — changing from coarse→fine is backward-compatible; the reverse is not.

***For Dev (4):***

1. `bunkai*create*atc` ***RPC signature****: Confirm output: `RETURNS uuid` (the new atc*id)? Input includes `p*project*id` for slug computation + RLS? ****Decision (Senior DEV)***: Yes — `returns uuid`, takes `p*project*id uuid` as first param. Slug computed as `lower(replace(p*title, ' ', '-')) || '/atc-' || substr(gen*random*uuid()::text, 1, 8)` — deterministic from inputs, no sequence dependency. RLS works because `project_id` is in the row.
2. ***Slug computation — pure SQL or app layer?****: The existing RPC is PL/pgSQL. Slug computation should live in the RPC (same transaction, no round-trip). Confirm? ****Decision (Senior DEV)***: Pure PL/pgSQL inside `bunkai*create*atc`. App layer sends title, RPC derives slug. Immutable after create.
3. ***Error code registration****: Add new codes to `API*ERROR*CODES` map or define them inline in route handlers? ****Decision (Senior DEV)***: Add to `API*ERROR*CODES` map for consistency. The map is the canonical registry that OpenAPI spec generation reads.
4. `affected*test*ids` ***query****: Does `test*steps` exist in the schema yet (it's part of EPIC-BK-5 Tests)? Or should the event payload skip this field until that schema migration lands? ****Decision (Senior DEV)***: `test*steps` does NOT exist yet. Emit `affected*test*ids: []` (empty) in MVP. When EPIC-BK-5 adds the table, update the event emission. The field name in the event contract stays the same — consumers handle empty arrays.

***For Design (0):***

No design questions — this is an API-only Story (no UI). The UI counterpart is [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-19#icft=BK-19](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-19#icft=BK-19).

## Refined Acceptance Criteria (Shift-Left QA pass — 2026-05-27)

> Refined and consolidated by QA during the pre-sprint Shift-Left review. Reconciliation reasoning (AC ↔ code divergences, decisions, edge cases, scope cuts) is captured in the ***🧪 Acceptance Test Plan (ATP)**** field and the ****Shift-Left Refinement*** comment on this issue.

```
Background:
  Given the workspace has a project P-1 with module M-10 and user story US-100
    And US-100 has acceptance criteria AC-1 and AC-2
    And the caller has a valid Personal Access Token with scope "atc:write"
    And module M-10 is a descendant of P-1's root module

# ---- Happy path ----

Scenario: Successful ATC creation with full payload
  Given a valid PAT with "atc:write" scope
  When the user POSTs /api/v1/atcs with body:
    | title                      | "Login with valid email"           |
    | module_id                  | M-10                               |
    | user*story*id              | US-100                             |
    | acceptance*criterion*ids   | ["AC-1"]                           |
    | layer                      | "UI"                               |
    | tags                       | ["smoke", "login"]                 |
    | steps[0] (position content)| 1, "Navigate to login page"        |
    | steps[1] (position content)| 2, "Enter email test@example.com"  |
    | steps[2] (position content)| 3, "Click submit"                  |
    | assertions[0] (pos content)| 1, "Response time < 2s"            |
  Then the API returns 201
    And the response body has an "id" field (uuid)
    And the response body has "slug" matching regex /^[a-z0-9-]+\/atc-[a-z0-9]{8}$/
    And the response body has "version" = 1
    And the response body has 3 steps with positions 1, 2, 3
    And the response body has 1 assertion with position 1
    And a row exists in atcs matching the returned id
    And 3 rows exist in atc*steps with the returned atc*id
    And 1 row exists in atc*assertions with the returned atc*id
    And 1 row exists in atc*acceptance*criteria with the returned atc_id and AC-1
    And an "atc.created" event is logged

Scenario: Successful PATCH update with cascade-replace
  Given an existing ATC with id ATC-42, version 1, 3 steps (positions 1,2,3), 2 assertions (positions 1,2)
  When the user PATCHes /api/v1/atcs/ATC-42 with body:
    | title    | "Login with valid email (updated)" |
    | steps[0] | position=1, content="New step 1"   |
    | steps[1] | position=2, content="New step 2"   |
    | tags     | ["smoke", "login", "updated"]      |
  Then the API returns 200
    And the response body has "version" = 2
    And the response body has "title" = "Login with valid email (updated)"
    And the response body has exactly 2 steps (old 3 are deleted)
    And the response body has 0 assertions (old 2 are deleted)
    And the DB has exactly 2 rows in atc_steps for ATC-42
    And the DB has 0 rows in atc_assertions for ATC-42
    And an "atc.updated" event is logged with affected*test*ids: []

# ---- Negative path ----

Scenario: Unauthenticated request rejected
  Given no Authorization header
  When the user POSTs /api/v1/atcs with valid payload
  Then the API returns 401
    And the error code is "unauthorized"

Scenario: Insufficient scope rejected
  Given a valid PAT with scope "atc:read" (no "atc:write")
  When the user POSTs /api/v1/atcs with valid payload
  Then the API returns 403
    And the error code is "forbidden"

Scenario: PATCH to non-existent ATC
  When the user PATCHes /api/v1/atcs/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
  Then the API returns 404
    And the error code is "not_found"

Scenario: AC belongs to different user story
  Given AC-9 belongs to US-200 (not US-100)
  When the user POSTs /api/v1/atcs with user*story*id=US-100 and acceptance*criterion*ids=["AC-9"]
  Then the API returns 422
    And the error code is "ac*outside*user_story"
    And no row is inserted in atcs, atc*steps, atc*assertions (transactional rollback)

Scenario: Module outside user story's project subtree
  Given US-100 belongs to project P-1
    And module M-99 belongs to project P-2 (different project)
  When the user POSTs /api/v1/atcs with user*story*id=US-100 and module_id=M-99
  Then the API returns 422
    And the error code is "module*outside*project_subtree"

Scenario: Step positions not strictly increasing from 1
  When the user POSTs /api/v1/atcs with steps positions [1, 3, 2]
  Then the API returns 422
    And the error code is "steps*position*invalid"
    And the response body lists the offending positions

Scenario: Step positions not starting at 1
  When the user POSTs /api/v1/atcs with steps positions [2, 3, 4]
  Then the API returns 422
    And the error code is "steps*position*invalid"

Scenario: Version conflict on concurrent PATCH
  Given ATC-42 is at version 1
  When two PATCH requests arrive with If-Match: "1"
  Then the first returns 200 with version 2
    And the second returns 409 with error code "conflict"
    And the conflict response includes the current version

# ---- Boundary / edge ----

Scenario: Title below minimum length
  Given an authenticated caller
  When the user POSTs /api/v1/atcs with title "AB" (2 characters)
  Then the API returns 422
    And the error code is "validation_failed"

Scenario: Empty steps array rejected
  Given an authenticated caller
  When the user POSTs /api/v1/atcs with steps: []
  Then the API returns 422
    And the error code is "validation_failed"

# ---- Integration ----

Scenario: Auth middleware integration — bearer token validation
  Given an invalid or expired PAT
  When the user POSTs /api/v1/atcs with valid payload
  Then the API returns 401
    And the error is raised BEFORE any DB query runs

Scenario: Transactional rollback on validation failure
  Given a POST that would pass Zod validation but fail cross-entity check (AC belongs to different US)
  When the user POSTs /api/v1/atcs
  Then the API returns 422
    And SELECT count(*) FROM atcs returns the same count as before the request
    And SELECT count(*) FROM atc_steps returns the same count as before
    And SELECT count(*) FROM atc_assertions returns the same count as before
```

******Markers used:**** all NEEDS PO/DEV CONFIRMATION items are explicitly resolved with Senior PO/DEV decisions inline in §Key Contract Decisions. The AC text above is final with those decisions applied.

***Copied from Refined AC by QA — Shift-Left pass 2026-05-27. PO ownership of this field returns after Estimation grooming; any further AC edits must go through PO.***

---

## Business Rules

- acceptance*criterion*ids[] must all belong to the supplied user*story*id (cross-entity check)
- module_id must equal the user story's module OR be a descendant module within the same project (subtree check)
- layer must be one of {UI, API, Unit} — enum constraint at DB and API level
- steps[] positions must be integers, strictly increasing, starting at 1
- tags[] max length is 10; title length 3..200 chars; step content max 2KB Markdown
- slug is computed once on create and is immutable across edits (renames do not change slug)
- version integer is monotonically increasing per ATC; PATCH increments by 1
- PATCH with no changes (empty body) = 200, no version bump, no event
- user*story*id is immutable on PATCH (silently ignored if provided)

---

## Scope

- POST /atcs endpoint with full body validation (title, module*id, user*story_id, AC ids, layer, steps[], assertions[], tags[])
- PATCH /atcs/{id} endpoint with full-replace semantics + cascade replace of steps/assertions
- Transactional insert/update of atcs + atc*steps + atc*assertions tables
- Slug computation "{module-slug}/atc-{id-first-8-chars}"
- Cross-entity validation (AC belongs to US, module in project subtree, layer enum, step positions)
- Bearer PAT auth with scope "atc:write"
- Optimistic locking via If-Match header on PATCH
- Event emission: atc.created on POST, atc.updated on PATCH (with affected*test*ids)
- OpenAPI spec entries for both endpoints with request/response schemas
- Unit + integration tests (cross-entity rules, transaction rollback on failure, auth gating)

---

## Workflow

A member calls POST /atcs with a fully-formed payload (title, module*id, user*story*id, AC ids, layer, steps, assertions, tags). The API layer validates the Zod schema first (synchronous, cheap), then resolves the PAT bearer token and checks atc:write scope. Cross-entity validation runs as read-only queries: ACs belong to US, module is in project subtree. Inside a single DB transaction, bunkai*create*atc inserts the atcs row, bulk-inserts atc*steps + atc*assertions, computes the slug, and returns the new id. On commit, the event bus fires atc.created with the full payload. PATCH /atcs/{id} follows the same path but: checks If-Match version guard, calls bunkai*save*atc (which updates header, delete-then-insert children, bumps version), and emits atc.updated with affected*test_ids.

# Senior Review — Technical & Business Decisions

> Answers to open questions raised during Shift-Left QA, resolved with Senior PO/DEV/QA judgment. This comment captures the rationale behind each decision. It does not duplicate the ATP mirror — scenarios, edge cases, and Gherkin outlines live there.

---

## Product Ownership — Senior PO

***1. Slug Collision on POST — 409 or auto-retry?***  
***Decision***: `409 slug_collision`.  
UUID-based slugs make collisions virtually impossible. Auto-retry masks real conflicts. Client changes module_id or title and retries.

***2. Event Consumers in MVP — who needs**** `atc.created` ****/**** `atc.updated` ****now?***  
***Decision***: Log to `event_log` table.  
[https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-20#icft=BK-20](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-20#icft=BK-20) (search index) and [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-21#icft=BK-21](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-21#icft=BK-21) (PATCH propagation) are Wave 2. No external webhooks exist. Events are persisted for future replay.

***3. Scope Naming — unified**** `atc:write` ****or split**** `atc:create` ****+**** `atc:update`****?***  
***Decision***: Single `atc:write` scope.  
Coarse-to-fine is backward-compatible; the reverse is not. If audit requirements demand granularity later, the scope can be split without invalidating existing PATs.

---

## Engineering — Senior DEV

***4. RPC Signature — what does**** `bunkai*create*atc` ****return?***  
***Decision***: `RETURNS uuid`, takes `p*project*id`.  
The route handler needs the id for the `201 Created` response without a follow-up round-trip. `bunkai*save*atc` returns void because the caller already knows the id — CREATE does not have that luxury.

***5. Slug Computation — app layer or PL/pgSQL?***  
***Decision***: PL/pgSQL inside the RPC.  
Must happen in the same transaction as the INSERT. Formula: `lower(replace(p*title, ' ', '-')) || '/atc-' || substr(gen*random_uuid()::text, 1, 8)`.

***6. Error Code Registration — centralized map or inline?***  
***Decision***: Add to `API*ERROR*CODES` map.  
The map is the canonical registry consumed by `buildOpenApiDocument()`. New codes: `ac*outside*user*story`, `module*outside*project*subtree`, `steps*position*invalid`, `slug_collision`.

***7.**** `affected*test*ids` ****Without**** `test_steps` ****Table — absent field or empty array?***  
***Decision***: `[]` (empty array).  
The `test_steps` table belongs to EPIC-BK-5 (not yet migrated). The field name is preserved for forward compatibility; consumers handle empty arrays.

***8. PATCH With Empty Body — 400 or 200?***  
***Decision***: `200 OK`, no version bump, no event.  
A no-op is not an error condition. This makes PATCH idempotent by definition.

---

## Quality Assurance — Senior QA

| Area  | Decision  | Testing Impact  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------------- |
| ***Auth Gating***  | `requireBearerToken` + `requireScope('atc:write')` on both endpoints  | 2 outlines covering 401 + 403. Reuses existing PAT fixture from token routes.  |
| ***Version Check***  | `If-Match` header present → `409` if mismatch, RPC skipped. Header absent → lenient mode.  | Concurrency test needs 2 parallel clients with the same version number.  |
| ***Transactional Rollback***  | Cross-entity validation before transaction, writes inside. On failure, zero DML runs.  | Integration test must assert row counts before/after across all 4 tables.  |
| ***Error Envelope***  | `ApiError` with semantic `error.code`, all returning 422.  | Assertions must validate `error.code`, not just HTTP status code.  |
| ***No-op PATCH***  | Empty body → 200, skip RPC and event emission.  | Single outline verifying version unchanged and `event_log` not written to.  |

## 🧪 Listo para QA — BK-18 (TMS-ATC API)

Desplegado en ***staging***: https://staging-upexbunkai.vercel.app

***PR:**** #27 (merge commit `54fcd8b`) · ****Branch:*** `feature/BK-18-atc-create-edit-api` (mergeada y borrada)

### Qué se entregó

- `POST /api/v1/atcs` — crea un ATC con steps + assertions en una sola llamada transaccional.
- `PATCH /api/v1/atcs/{id}` — edición estilo PUT (reemplazo total de steps/assertions).

### Cómo probar

- ***Auth:*** Personal Access Token (PAT) con scope `atc:write` en header `Authorization: Bearer bk*pat*...`. La sesión por cookie también funciona. Un token con solo `atc:read` → 403.
- ***Slug:*** `{module-slug}/atc-{8 hex}` — inmutable tras crear (no cambia al renombrar).
- ***PATCH optimistic locking:*** header `If-Match: <version>` → 409 si la versión no coincide. Body vacío `{}` = no-op 200 (sin incremento de versión, sin evento).
- ***Inmutables en PATCH:*** `user*story*id`, `module_id`, `slug`.

### Escenarios del ATP (todos verificados a nivel RPC contra la DB real; ver la matriz en el PR #27)

- Crear con payload válido → 201, slug con regex, version 1, steps + assertions, evento `atc.created`.
- AC que pertenece a otra User Story → 422 `ac*outside*user_story` (sin filas insertadas — rollback transaccional).
- Module fuera del subtree del project de la US → 422 `module*outside*project_subtree`.
- Posiciones de steps inválidas (`[1,3,2]` / `[2,3,4]`) → 422 `steps*position*invalid` (lista las posiciones infractoras).
- PATCH a un id inexistente → 404.
- Conflicto de versión (If-Match viejo) → 409 `conflict` (incluye la versión actual).
- Sin auth / PAT inválido → 401. Scope insuficiente (`atc:read`) → 403.

### Notas

- Los eventos van a la tabla `activity*log` (`atc.created` / `atc.updated`); `affected*test*ids` = `[]` en el MVP (la tabla `test*steps` llega con EPIC-BK-5).
- Fuera de alcance (otras stories): GET/search (BK-20), duplicar (BK-23), UI (BK-19), reporte de uso (BK-22).
- Contrato completo en OpenAPI: `/api/openapi` (paths `/api/v1/atcs` y `/api/v1/atcs/{id}`).

### Ely - 8/6/2026, 14:11:10

## QA Testing Complete — BK-18

***Environment******:*** Staging (`https://staging-upexbunkai.vercel.app/api/v1`)
***Result******:*** FAILED (12/13 TCs — 92%)
***Surfaces******:*** API + DB (no UI — UI is BK-19)

### Test data used

- Project "Openapi Test Project" · User story FSX-45 (`b1f68acf-...`) · Modules "Credit Cards" / "Billing"

### Verified behaviors

- Happy POST `/atcs` → 201, version 1, slug valid, DB rows + `atc.created` event — VERIFIED
- Authorization (401 no-auth, 403 missing `atc:write` scope, 401 invalid bearer) — VERIFIED
- Anchoring moat: cross-US AC → 422 `ac*outside*user*story` with rollback; cross-project module → 422 `module*outside*project*subtree` — VERIFIED
- Step-position validation (`[1,3,2]`, `[2,3,4]` → 422 `steps*position*invalid`) — VERIFIED
- Optimistic-lock conflict: stale `If-Match` → 409 with `current_version` — VERIFIED
- Boundary validation (short title, empty steps → 422) — VERIFIED
- Transactional integrity: all rollbacks left zero DB residue; slug-uniqueness constraint present; cleanup cascaded with zero orphans — VERIFIED

### Failed verification

- ***Happy-path PATCH ****`/atcs/{id}`**** (AC******:****** "PATCH returns 200 with version 2") — FAILED***

### Defect

- ***BK-96*** — ATC Library: ATC PATCH API: Happy-path PATCH /atcs/{id} returns 412 instead of 200 though the edit commits (Severity Major, non-blocking).

***Verdict******:*** FAILED. Recommend NOT QA Sign-Off until BK-96 is fixed and the H2 happy-path PATCH re-runs green. The 12 passing scenarios remain eligible for ROI evaluation.

***Artifacts******:*** ATP BK-94 · ATR BK-95 · Defect BK-96

### Ely - 10/6/2026, 23:48:13

## ✅ Blocker no longer applies — story resumed

This story was blocked in relation to BK-96, which is already ***Closed*** — no open defect blocks this story anymore.

This story has been moved back to ***In Test*** so testing can resume. Please continue the story run.

---

### Ely - 21/6/2026, 1:05:42

> ***SUCCESS:**** ****QA Verdict******:****** PASSED (GO) — re-run 2026-06-20, staging, API+DB.***

***Re-tested BK-18 end-to-end (modality jira-xray).*** 12/12 test cases PASSED. No open defects.

***Blocking defect BK-96 — verified FIXED end-to-end.*** This closes the gap left by the prior code-review-only retest. The fix moved the optimistic-lock token to a custom `X-If-Match` header (PR #30, commit `421a917`): `X-If-Match` matching → 200 + version bump + cascade replace; stale → 409 conflict; absent → 200. Legacy `If-Match` still returns 412 at the Vercel edge (documented limitation — `X-If-Match` is the contract).

***Coverage (refactored, parametrized — EP + BVA)******:***

- ATP BK-94 updated; 12 Xray Tests BK-149…BK-160 created, executed under Test Execution BK-95 (all PASSED), shared Pre-Condition BK-161.
- Anchoring moat (AC→US, module→subtree), auth/scope gate, step-position rule, request boundaries, transactional rollback (DB-verified), PATCH happy path + optimistic lock + 404 + empty-body no-op + immutable fields.

***DB integrity******:*** transactional rollback verified zero-residue; created ATCs cleaned up (0/0/0).

***Observation (non-blocking)******:*** `affected*test*ids` returns `null` where the MVP contract said `[]` — recommend dev confirm intended representation.

***Recommendation******:*** ready for QA sign-off.

### Nahuel Gomez - 30/6/2026, 5:40:34

## Automated Tests — Implemented (2026-06-29)

7 automated test cases written against staging, all passing.

### Component

`tests/components/api/AtcsApi.ts` — KATA component with 3 ATCs registered in `ApiFixture`.

### Test Coverage (sandbox, waiting on BK-175/BK-177 for full project integration)

| ATC ID | Scenario | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BK-149 | POST happy create (valid payload, layer enum) | ✅ Passing |
| BK-150 | POST auth gate (401 no auth, 401 invalid token) | ✅ Passing |
| BK-153 | POST step validation (non-increasing positions → 422) | ✅ Passing |
| BK-154 | POST boundary validation (title min/max length → 422) | ✅ Passing |
| BK-156 | PATCH happy path with X-If-Match (full-replace, version bump) | ✅ Passing |

### Quality Gates

- `types:check` — ✅ Clean
- `lint:check` — ✅ Clean  
- `kata:manifest:check` — ✅ Up to date (5 components, 12 ATCs)
- Test execution — ✅ 7/7 passing against live staging

### Known Constraint

Test file uses `.sandbox.ts` project (no auth-setup dependency) because staging auth endpoint is blocked by BK-177. When BK-175/BK-177 are resolved, file moves to `tests/integration/atc/` under the `integration` project.

### Infrastructure changes

- ***loginEndpoint**** fixed: `/auth/login` → `/api/v1/auth/signin`. The old endpoint 404s (BK-177). The BK-166 endpoint works. ****Integration project is now unblocked.***
- ***AuthApi*** updated to use sign-in PAT (not session token) for API auth — matches BK-166 coexistence pattern.
- ***meEndpoint*** fixed to `/api/v1/me` (actual path).
- ***auth.types.ts*** updated to match real API response shapes.
- ***jira-attach-evidence.ts*** script created for attaching screenshots to Jira tickets via REST API.

### CI/CD

- All tests pass in sandbox project. Allure reports at:

  https://nelgoez.github.io/bunkai-qa-engineering/staging/sanity/

### Known gaps (unchanged)

- BK-150 403 scope test — blocked on restricted-scope PAT
- Sandbox → `.test.ts` promotion — now feasible since api-setup works
- Nightly regression doesn't include sandbox tests yet (PR gate + manual only)

### Next-step candidates

| Priority | Ticket | Summary | Est. time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | BK-182 | Bearer run can't resolve active workspace | ~15 min |
| 2 | BK-22 | ATC "Used in N tests" report | ~15 min |
| 3 | BK-57 | PATCH /modules/{id} atomicity | ~20 min |
| 4 | BK-36 | Abort a run in progress | ~20 min |
