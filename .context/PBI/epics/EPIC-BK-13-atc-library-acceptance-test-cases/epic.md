## Description

# EPIC-BK-4 — ATC Library (Acceptance Test Cases)

Maps PRD EPIC-BK-004 (US 4.1..4.6) and SRS FR-010..FR-014.

***Capability***: The reusable testing primitives layer. An ATC (Acceptance Test Case) is a small, named, reusable test fragment anchored to a User Story + ≥1 Acceptance Criterion. Tests are composed by chaining ATCs (see EPIC-BK-5). Editing an ATC propagates to every Test that references it — one-edit-many-tests.

## Wave

***Wave 3*** — ATC Library (Acceptance Test Cases). Bunkai's differentiator — one-edit-many-tests. Authoring layer that Wave 4 (Tests + Manual Runs) chains together. Cannot start before Wave 2 (Project + Module hierarchy) lands. See `.context/master-implementation-plan.md` §5.

## Scope

- US 4.1 + 4.2 — Create ATC anchored to US/AC with steps, assertions, layer, tags (`FR-010`).
- US 4.3 — Search ATCs by name and module via textual autocomplete (`FR-011`).
- US 4.4 — Edit ATC with cascade-propagation to chained Tests; version bump; emit affected*test*ids (`FR-012`).
- US 4.5 — "Used in N tests" report on each ATC (`FR-013`).
- US 4.6 — Duplicate an ATC as starting point for a similar one (`FR-014`).

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Semantic search via pgvector + embeddings — ships Phase 2 (separate FR).
- ATC parameterization editors (equivalence partitions, boundary values, decision tables, state transitions) — Phase 3.
- Bulk import of ATCs from external test repos — Phase 2.

## Business Rules

- ATC MUST be anchored to one `user*story*id` AND have ≥1 `acceptance*criterion*id`.
- All `acceptance*criterion*ids` MUST belong to the same `user*story*id` (no cross-US AC binding).
- `module_id` of an ATC MUST be the US's module OR a descendant module of the same Project.
- ATC `layer` ∈ `{UI`, `API`, `Unit`} — strict enum.
- Step `position` strictly increasing from 1; assertion `position` same rule.
- ATC edit increments `version` integer; Tests referencing it auto-reflect changes (no copy-on-write).
- ATC slug format: `{module-slug}/{atc-id-padded`} — stable across renames.
- Duplicate creates new ATC row with title suffix `(copy)` unless override provided.

## Stories

- BK-18 — ATC create + edit REST API (POST/PATCH /atcs, transactional steps + assertions) (FR-010a)
- BK-19 — ATC creation UI (multi-step + assertion builder) (FR-010b)
- BK-20 — ATC search & autocomplete (FTS + rank) (FR-011)
- BK-21 — ATC edit propagation (cascade + version + affected*test*ids) (FR-012)
- BK-22 — ATC usage report ("Used in N tests") (FR-013)
- BK-23 — ATC duplicate (FR-014)
