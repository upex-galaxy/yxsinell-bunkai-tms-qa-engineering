## Overview

***Source spec:*** BK-022

## User story

***As a*** QA Engineer
***I want to*** see the history of past Runs for a Test, newest first, filterable by outcome
***So that*** I can compare results over time and spot flaky areas

## Definition of done

- [ ] A Test shows its past Runs ordered newest first
- [ ] Each history entry shows the Run's outcome, environment, executor mode, and when it ran
- [ ] The history can be filtered to show only passed, only failed, or only aborted Runs
- [ ] A Test with no Runs yet shows an empty-state message instead of a blank list
- [ ] Older Runs can be loaded beyond the first page
- [ ] Clearing a filter restores the full newest-first list
