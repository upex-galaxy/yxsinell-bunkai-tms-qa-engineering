## Overview

***Source spec:*** BK-020

## User story

***As a*** QA Engineer
***I want to*** mark each step passed, failed, or blocked while executing, with an optional note and evidence link
***So that*** the parent ATC verdict and overall run progress update as I go, and teammates watching see it live

## Definition of done

- [ ] The engineer can mark any pending step passed, failed, or blocked
- [ ] A note and an evidence link can be attached to a step result, both optional
- [ ] The parent ATC verdict updates from the step results (passed when all pass, failed when any fails, blocked when any is blocked and none failed)
- [ ] The overall run progress percentage advances as steps are resolved
- [ ] A teammate watching the same Run sees the verdict and progress update live without refreshing
- [ ] Reporting a result on a Run that has already finished or been aborted is blocked with a clear message
- [ ] The latest reported result for a step is the one shown
