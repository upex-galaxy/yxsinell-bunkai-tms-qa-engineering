## Overview

***Source spec:*** BK-021

## User story

***As a*** QA Engineer
***I want to*** abort a Run that is in progress, giving a reason
***So that*** the remaining unexecuted steps are marked skipped and the Run is cleanly closed as aborted

## Definition of done

- [ ] The engineer can abort a Run that is still in progress
- [ ] A reason of at least 3 characters is required to abort
- [ ] All steps not yet executed are marked skipped
- [ ] Already-executed step results are preserved unchanged
- [ ] The Run's final state is shown as aborted, with the stated reason visible
- [ ] Aborting a Run that has already finished or been aborted is blocked with a clear message
- [ ] The aborted Run remains visible in the Test's run history
