# QA Handoff Mirror - BK-39 Shift-Left Review Update

BK-39 was re-refined with the updated Ely-style `/shift-left-refinement` structure and reviewed through `/expert-panel-review` before publication.

The previous simple comment mirror was deleted to avoid duplicate shift-left executions. The Jira description is the primary source of truth; this comment is the single QA/ATP handoff mirror.

## Executive Summary

BK-39 defines how an already-started Run is finished with a final verdict. The key quality concern is state consistency: final verdict, finish time, pending-step skip handling, and preservation of executed results must happen without partial or duplicate terminal state.

## Refinement Delta

| Area | Added / clarified | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Contract decisions | 9 decisions covering final verdict, terminal states, pending-to-skipped, preservation, atomicity, concurrency, AI/CI parity, permissions, and defect scope | Gives Dev an implementable contract, not just Gherkin |
| AC reconciliation | 9 source claims reconciled from the original DoD, BK-34, and BK-70 context | Shows what stayed, expanded, or moved out of scope |
| Risk matrix | 10 edge cases, including 5 High risks | Makes negative/boundary coverage visible before sprint planning |
| ATP draft | 9 ATP rows | Gives QA/test-documentation a direct handoff |
| Readiness gates | QA testability passes; PO, Dev, Data/API, UX, and Security/Ops need confirmation | Prevents a false “ready” signal where decisions remain open |

## ATP Draft Summary

| ID | Type | Scenario | Priority | Surface |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BK-39-ATC-01 | Happy | Finish in-progress Run with `passed` or `failed` verdict and show finish time | High | UI + API + DB |
| BK-39-ATC-02 | State transition | Pending steps become `skipped` on finish | High | API + DB |
| BK-39-ATC-03 | Regression | Already-executed step results remain unchanged | High | API + DB |
| BK-39-ATC-04 | Negative | Missing final verdict blocks finish | High | UI + API |
| BK-39-ATC-05 | Negative | Finished or aborted Run cannot be finished again | High | API + DB |
| BK-39-ATC-06 | Boundary | Concurrent finish attempts keep one consistent terminal outcome | High | API + DB |
| BK-39-ATC-07 | Integration | Human, AI Agent, and CI finish handling stay consistent | Medium | API |
| BK-39-ATC-08 | UX | Pending steps warning / confirmation before finish | Medium | UI |
| BK-39-ATC-09 | Scope guard | `failed` verdict does not require defect unless PO changes scope | Medium | API |

## High And Medium Risks

| Severity | Risk | Expected handling | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High | Finish without verdict | Block; no Run or step-result mutation | BK-39-ATC-04 |
| High | Mixed executed + pending steps | Preserve executed results; only pending becomes `skipped` | BK-39-ATC-02 / BK-39-ATC-03 |
| High | Already finished or aborted Run | Block; no mutation | BK-39-ATC-05 |
| High | Concurrent finish attempts | One terminal mutation wins; no partial state | BK-39-ATC-06 |
| High | AI/CI bypassing permissions | Reject unauthorized caller; keep actor traceable | BK-39-ATC-07 |
| Medium | All steps already executed | Finish records verdict/time; no step result changes | BK-39-ATC-03 |
| Medium | `failed` verdict without defect | Allow for BK-39 unless PO changes scope | BK-39-ATC-09 |
| Medium | Accidental finish with pending steps | Confirmation recommended before converting pending to skipped | BK-39-ATC-08 |
| Medium | Client/server clock mismatch | Server-side finish time should be source of truth | Open Dev confirmation |
| Medium | Final result display stale | Show verdict and finish time after completion | BK-39-ATC-01 |

## Open Confirmations

| Owner | Decision needed | Expert recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PO | Are final verdicts only `passed` and `failed`? | Keep only those two for BK-39; defer extra verdicts to a future Story |
| PO | Can a Run finish as `failed` without a linked defect? | Yes for BK-39; defect lifecycle belongs to BK-40 through BK-43 |
| Dev | How are lifecycle state and final verdict stored? | Keep terminal lifecycle state conceptually separate from business verdict |
| Dev | How is finish applied atomically? | Use transaction or equivalent conditional update |
| PO/Dev | What happens on double finish/concurrent finish? | First terminal action wins; later attempt does not mutate data |
| UX/PO | Should pending-step skip require confirmation? | Yes when pending steps exist |
| Security/Dev | Which identity do AI Agent / CI calls use? | Same authorization model as human callers, with traceable actor/executor mode |

## Dependency Note

BK-39 depends on BK-34 because BK-39 consumes an already-started Run with initialized step results, selected environment, executor mode, and history visibility. BK-39 does not redefine Run creation.

Functional boundaries:

- BK-34: start Run and initialize pending checklist.
- BK-36: abort Run.
- BK-37 / BK-38: run history and reporting totals.
- BK-40 through BK-43: defect lifecycle and Jira sync.
- BK-70: Test Repository model, Run entities, step results, and access model.

## Out Of Scope For BK-39 QA

- Starting a Run.
- Editing individual step results before finish.
- Aborting a Run.
- Run history filtering and aggregate reporting.
- Defect creation, defect listing, defect heatmap, or Jira defect sync.
- Reopening or amending a finished Run.
- Creating or editing the underlying Test definition.

## Publication Status

- Description updated with the Ely-style refinement package.
- QA/ATP handoff mirror updated in this single comment.
- Previous simple mirror deleted to avoid duplication.
- Labels preserved: `shift-left-reviewed`, `shift-left-2026-06-13`.
- Status preserved: Estimation.
- Dependency preserved: BK-39 depends on BK-34.

# Acceptance Test Report - BK-39

## QA Completion Summary

***Verdict***: PASSED WITH FOLLOW-UP
***Environment***: staging (`https://staging-upexbunkai.vercel.app`)
***Tester***: `bunkai-staging-user@xenievzoau.resend.app`
***Date***: 2026-06-26 UTC

BK-39 final-run finish behavior passed API, UI, and DB validation for the core story contract. One dependency follow-up remains: Bearer-based `POST /api/v1/runs` could not resolve active workspace, so Run creation for AI/CI/PAT callers needs separate BK-34/PAT workspace-resolution follow-up. The BK-39 finish endpoint itself accepted Bearer `run:execute` and closed existing Runs correctly.

## Results

| Area | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Finish success | PASS | Run `81ddd65f-d11b-44d0-b9c4-5e9bc09dc1d3` -> `passed`, `finished_at`, version `2`. |
| Pending steps skipped | PASS | DB shows `2` skipped, `0` pending after finish. |
| Missing verdict guard | PASS | Run `3e3a66ba-2912-48f0-b97a-ce53b2363060` returned 422 `finish*verdict*invalid` and stayed `running`. |
| Terminal guard | PASS | Retry finish on `81ddd65f-d11b-44d0-b9c4-5e9bc09dc1d3` returned 409 `run*not*finishable`. |
| Concurrent finish | PASS | Run `a0c00be8-e440-440a-a42e-291cab3fb843`: one request 200, competing request 409. |
| UI finish flow | PASS | Run `0ee62287-ad06-4faf-b00b-b7c961143c9c`: modal warned `2 pending steps will be marked skipped`; final verdict visible. |
| Already-executed result preservation | NOT RUN | No public step-result update endpoint available to put a step into executed state before finish. |

## Evidence

| Type | Path / Query |
| --- | --- |
| Screenshot | `evidence/BK-39-ui-final-verdict.png` |
| API output | Captured in session logs for finish 200/409/422 and concurrency first-wins. |
| DB cross-check | `public.runs`, `public.run*atcs`, `public.run*steps`, `public.activity_log` for listed Run IDs. |

## Test Data Used

| Entity | ID / Value | Cleanup |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace | `545d5efe-a168-4f32-a4be-a148a2fc96db` | Existing staging QA workspace; no cleanup. |
| Project | `d75e73ac-b42a-487e-99e8-ac55859fc392` | Existing BK-34 seed project; no cleanup. |
| Test fixture | `174d3ad2-89d0-49b0-aafa-469d0b11d9a0` | Keep as reusable BK-39 sprint fixture. |
| Runs | `81ddd65f-d11b-44d0-b9c4-5e9bc09dc1d3`, `3e3a66ba-2912-48f0-b97a-ce53b2363060`, `a0c00be8-e440-440a-a42e-291cab3fb843`, `0ee62287-ad06-4faf-b00b-b7c961143c9c` | Historical execution evidence; no destructive cleanup. |

## Defects / Follow-Up

| Type | Summary | Severity | Blocks BK-39? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Follow-up defect | Bearer `POST /api/v1/runs` failed with `No active workspace could be resolved for this request`; cookie-session creation works. | Medium | No - BK-39 finish endpoint passed with Bearer on existing Run. |

## AC Verified Behaviors

| Behavior | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Finish an in-progress Run with `passed` or `failed` | PASS |
| Record finish time | PASS |
| Mark pending steps skipped | PASS |
| Preserve executed step results | NOT RUN - no step-result update endpoint in scope |
| Block missing verdict | PASS |
| Block already closed Run | PASS |
| Handle concurrent finish attempts consistently | PASS |
| Show final verdict and finish time in UI | PASS |
| Failed verdict independent from defect lifecycle | PASS by scope/implementation contract |

## Final Recommendation

Move BK-39 forward as QA passed with a documented follow-up for PAT/Bearer Run creation. Do not block the BK-39 finish-verdict story on that dependency because the finish endpoint, UI, DB mutation, and audit behavior satisfy the story's core acceptance contract.

# Expert Panel Review - Sprint Testing Audit BK-39

> ***SUCCESS:***  Sprint-testing package accepted. No execution rerun needed.

## Executive Summary

BK-39 is accepted as `PASSED WITH FOLLOW-UP`. The finish behavior is validated across API, UI, and DB. The only uncovered/limited area is not a BK-39 blocker: Bearer-based Run creation cannot resolve active workspace, which belongs to the Run-start/PAT workspace-resolution dependency path.

## Evidence Used

| Source | Evidence | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jira | BK-39 story, ACs, shift-left ATP mirror, deployment comment | High |
| Repo | `app/api/v1/runs/[id]/finish/route.ts`, `0037*run*finish.sql`, `RunnerView.tsx` | High |
| API | Finish success 200, missing verdict 422, terminal retry 409, concurrent first-wins | High |
| DB | `runs`, `run*steps`, `activity*log` cross-checks | High |
| UI | `evidence/BK-39-ui-final-verdict.png` | High |

## Expert Findings

| Role | Finding | Recommendation | Source Label |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Senior Product Owner | Core user outcome is met: a running Run can close with visible final verdict. | Accept BK-39 with follow-up separated from the story. | API / UI |
| Senior QA Lead | Risk-based core paths passed; one preservation TC was not executable due missing public step-result endpoint. | Mark BK-39 passed with explicit NOT RUN scope note instead of overstating 100% execution. | API / DB |
| Senior Technical Architect | Finish transaction design matches story: status, finish time, version bump, pending-step skip, audit. | Keep finish logic accepted; route Bearer start-run workspace issue to dependency follow-up. | Repo / DB |
| Senior Developers | Endpoint/RPC error handling returns correct 422/409 contracts. | Add separate test/fix for PAT `POST /runs` active workspace resolution. | API |
| Senior Security/AppSec Engineer | Finish endpoint uses authenticated actor + `run:execute` and workspace write assertion through RPC. | Do not weaken auth; fix Bearer workspace resolution at run creation without bypassing membership checks. | Repo / API |
| Delivery/Scrum Lead | Follow-up is dependency-class, not release blocker for BK-39. | Move story forward; create/track follow-up if product wants AI/CI start-run readiness in same sprint. | Inference |
| Workflow/Jira | ATR must include QA Completion Summary, data used, defects/follow-up, and AC behavior table. | Publish one complete ATR-style comment plus this audit closure. | Repo |
| Engram Curator | BK-39 adds a useful pattern: cookie session can be required for run creation while finish can still be validated with Bearer. | Save role-specific learning for future run-execution tickets. | Engram Candidate |
| Skeptical Reviewer | Accepted with a caveat: do not claim executed-result preservation was tested. | Keep `NOT RUN` explicit and avoid blocking on unrelated start-run workspace bug. | Evidence Review |

## Report Improvements Added

- Added `QA Completion Summary` to `test-report.md`.
- Included environment, result, defects/follow-up, test data IDs, cleanup notes, AC verified behaviors, and screenshot evidence.
- Kept `already-executed result preservation` as `NOT RUN`, not PASS.

## Residual Follow-Up

- Investigate Bearer `POST /api/v1/runs` returning `No active workspace could be resolved for this request` despite valid auth and memberships.
- Add or expose a public step-result update route before claiming direct preservation coverage for already-executed run steps.

## Panel Verdict

VERDICT: ACCEPTED

# BK-39 Follow-Up Created

BK-39 remains `PASSED WITH FOLLOW-UP`.

Follow-up bug created and linked:

| Key | Summary | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BK-182 | Bearer run creation cannot resolve active workspace | AI/CI/PAT callers cannot create Runs through `POST /api/v1/runs`; cookie-session creation works, and BK-39 finish endpoint works with Bearer on existing Runs. |

This does not block BK-39 because the finish-verdict endpoint, UI finish flow, DB state mutation, and terminal guards passed validation.
