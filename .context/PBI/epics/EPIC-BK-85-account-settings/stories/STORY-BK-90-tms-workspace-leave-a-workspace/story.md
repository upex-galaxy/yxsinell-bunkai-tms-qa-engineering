## Overview

## User story

As a QA Lead (Mateo Silva) I want to leave a workspace I no longer need, so that my account stays scoped to the teams I actually work with.

## QA Refinements (Shift-Left Analysis) — Added 2026-06-10

> Refined Acceptance Criteria live in the `acceptance_criteria` field — the 2 existing scenarios were sharpened in place (refinements, not replacements) and 3 new scenarios were added to fill gaps the original 2 leave open. Every new scenario is flagged ********NEEDS PO/DEV CONFIRMATION**** in the field itself.

### Central finding — the multi-owner gate is the highest-leverage open question

Scenario 2 only describes the SOLE-owner block ("Mateo is the only owner of Acme QA"). It does not say whether the gate is "you are AN owner" (which would also block a co-owner from leaving) or "you are the LAST remaining owner" (which would not). The schema (`workspace_members.role`) does not prevent multiple `owner` rows per workspace. This refinement assumes the gate is count-based ("are you the LAST remaining owner") as New Scenario C — but if the team intends NO co-owner to ever leave without an explicit ownership-transfer step first, this scenario is invalid and a "transfer ownership" sub-flow becomes new, unscoped work that would materially change the story's size beyond its current 3 SP.

### Open Questions for PO / Dev

1. ********Can a workspace have more than one member with ****`role = 'owner'`****, and if so, can any of them leave freely as long as at least one owner remains — or must ownership be transferred/reduced to exactly one other owner first?**** Blocks New Scenario C (co-owner leave) — without an answer this outline cannot be designed or estimated.
2. ********What happens when a user leaves the only workspace they belong to**** — is "leave" blocked (a "must belong to at least one workspace" guard, symmetric to the sole-owner guard), or does the user land on the onboarding/no-workspace flow? Blocks New Scenario A (boundary outline).
3. ********(Dev)**** Should workspace-scoped Personal Access Tokens (`access*tokens` rows where `workspace*id` = the left workspace and `user_id` = the leaving user) be auto-revoked as part of the "leave workspace" transaction, or left as functionally-dead-but-not-formally-revoked rows? Determines whether New Scenario B's "no cascade" claim needs a PAT-revocation caveat.
