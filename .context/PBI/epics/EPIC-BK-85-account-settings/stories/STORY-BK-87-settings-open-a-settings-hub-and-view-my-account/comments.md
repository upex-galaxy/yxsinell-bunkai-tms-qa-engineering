## 🔍 Shift-Left QA Review — BK-87

***Quality Score***: Needs Improvement
***Risk Score***: 10/20 (HIGH)
***Mode***: Pre-sprint refinement (Shift-Left)

### Findings
- ***Ambiguities***: 4 — Settings section vs single page, identity fields, workspace list columns, entry point location
- ***Gaps***: 5 — zero ACs, no chrome location, RLS rules unstated, BK-86 sign-out boundary, error/empty states
- ***Edge cases***: 8 identified (no workspace, session expiry, direct URL, network failure, 10+ workspaces, null metadata, suspended user, RLS denial)
- ***ACs refined***: 7 (AC1-AC7)
- ***Test outlines drafted***: 9 (3 positive, 3 negative, 2 boundary, 1 integration)

### PO Questions Pending
1. Boundary between BK-86 and BK-87 — does BK-87 include sign-out?
2. Where does the Settings entry point live in the app chrome?

### Next
→ Moved to ***Estimation*** for team sizing and dev planning.

***PO answers — 2026-06-08***

Both critical questions resolved:

1. ***Settings entry point*** → Topbar user menu (avatar/initials) with dropdown containing "Settings" and "Sign out". Also accessible via direct URL /settings.

1. ***BK-86/BK-87 boundary*** → Sign-out is exclusive to BK-86. BK-87 delivers only identity display + workspace list in the Account section within Settings.

BK-87 is now unblocked and ready for Estimation.
