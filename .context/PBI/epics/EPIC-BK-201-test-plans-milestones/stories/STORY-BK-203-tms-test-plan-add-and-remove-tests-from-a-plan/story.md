## Overview

## User story

As Elena Vargas, Senior QA Engineer, I want to add existing Tests to a test plan and remove them, so that the plan reflects exactly the verification scope agreed for its goal.

## Context

A Test Plan is only useful once it holds the right Tests. This story delivers membership curation: picking Tests from the project's existing test library and removing ones that no longer belong. Membership is by reference — the same Test can serve several plans (a smoke plan and a regression plan may share it), and removing a Test from a plan never touches the Test itself. This story activates once its dependency epics (Tests, Manual Execution & Runs) and the plan container story are live.
