## Overview

## User story

As Mateo Silva, QA Lead, I want the plan view to show each member test's latest run outcome and an aggregate progress summary, so that I can answer "what does this cycle cover and where does it stand?" in under a minute.

## Context

Runs already record outcomes for every executed Test. This story surfaces those existing outcomes inside the plan: each member test shows the verdict of its most recent run, and the plan header aggregates them into a progress summary. Nothing here executes anything new — progress is a read-only projection of the run history the product already keeps. This story activates once its dependency epics (Tests, Manual Execution & Runs) and the plan membership story are live.
