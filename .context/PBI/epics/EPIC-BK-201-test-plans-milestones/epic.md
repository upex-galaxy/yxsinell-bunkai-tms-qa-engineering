**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Planning

## Description

Bunkai already lets teams execute Tests through ad-hoc manual Runs. What QA Leads like Mateo Silva still cannot do is answer "what does this sprint actually cover?" without assembling the picture by hand. This epic adds ***planned, organized execution**** on top of the existing run machinery: ****Test Plans**** group existing Tests around a goal or release, and ****Milestones*** group plans under a target date, with progress computed automatically from run outcomes.

***Scope boundary.*** A Test Plan is a curated set of references to existing Tests — it introduces no new authoring or execution surface. A Milestone is a named delivery goal with a target date that aggregates the readiness of its attached plans. All progress derives from the outcomes of Runs that already exist; nothing in this epic is manually editable progress. Scheduled plan runs and automation-sourced outcomes are explicitly outside this epic.

## Traceability

- Builds directly on epic ***BK-24 Tests (chains of ATCs)**** — plans group the Tests that epic delivers — and on epic ****BK-30 Manual Execution & Runs*** — plan progress and milestone readiness read the run outcomes that epic records.
- Post-MVP roadmap feature: the PRD Phase 2 scope lists Test Plans (saved subsets of tests). Milestones extend that same planning capability to release goals.
- Closed plans become read-only history, feeding the audit-evidence narrative of epic BK-44 Coverage & Traceability.
