## Test Description

## TC03 — Active Memberships Filter: DB Cross-Validation

***Group******:*** A-GET

***Precondition******:***

- Authenticated user (QA bot) with a valid Bearer PAT
- User's membership state in `workspace_members` is known (mix of active / non-active rows, or at least one active row)

***Steps******:***

1. Query `workspace*members` for the user: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM workspace*members WHERE user*id = '<user*id>' AND status = 'active'`
2. GET /api/v1/workspaces with the same user's Bearer PAT
3. Count the workspaces returned in the API response
4. Compare the DB active-membership count against the API workspace count

***Expected******:***

- API response workspace count equals the DB active-membership count for the user
- Suspended / invited (non-active) memberships are NOT included in the API response
- Confirms GET /api/v1/workspaces filters by `status = 'active'` at the DB level

***Auth******:*** Bearer PAT + DB read access (DBHub MCP / direct SQL against the workspace_members table)
