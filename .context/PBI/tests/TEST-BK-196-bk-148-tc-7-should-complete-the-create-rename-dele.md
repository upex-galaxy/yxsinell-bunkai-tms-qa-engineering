## Test Design

```gherkin
@medium @regression @automation-candidate @BK-148
Scenario: should create, rename and delete an environment via the UI
  # === PRECONDITIONS ===
  Given a member is on the project explorer for "{project}"
  # === ACTION + VALIDATIONS ===
  When they click [data-testid=environment-add]
  And submit "{name}" in [data-testid=create-environment-name] via [data-testid=create-environment-submit]
  Then a row [data-testid=explorer-environment-{id}] appears with "{name}"
  When they open [data-testid=environment-menu-{id}] and click [data-testid=environment-rename-{id}]
  And submit "{new_name}" in [data-testid=rename-environment-name]
  Then the row shows "{new_name}"
  When they open the menu and click [data-testid=environment-remove-{id}]
  And confirm [data-testid=delete-environment-confirm]
  Then the row is removed from the list
```

## Variables

| Variable | How to obtain |
| --- | --- |
| {project} | A project the member owns |
| {name},{new_name} | Unique names not already present |
| {id} | Read from the created row's testid |

## Architecture

E2E (Playwright). All controls carry data-testid — no fallback locators needed.

## Test IDs

`environment-add`, `create-environment-name`, `create-environment-submit`, `explorer-environment-{id}`, `environment-menu-{id}`, `environment-rename-{id}`, `rename-environment-name`, `rename-environment-submit`, `environment-remove-{id}`, `delete-environment-confirm` (`project-explorer.tsx`, `*-form.tsx`, `delete-environment-dialog.tsx`).

## Expected

Each CRUD step reflects in the list; success shows a sonner toast; no errors.
