## Forbidden invocations

**NEVER invoke `/sdd-*` skills from this workflow.** SDD is an optional
user-installed ceremony; this skill ships self-contained and does not chain
SDD under any condition. If you need to refactor KATA, fixtures, cli/,
scripts/, or api/schemas/ pipeline, exit this skill first and invoke
`/framework-development` — which itself runs Plan → Code → Verify → Archive
natively (no SDD required).

This boundary is mechanical, not advisory: `scripts/lint-skills.ts` rejects
any `/sdd-` mention outside this section. See:
`.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/skill-composition-strategy.md` §4
(governs users who manually install SDD).

# Sprint Testing — Plan, Execute, Report per Ticket

Drive the manual / exploratory QA loop for a single ticket during a sprint. Three stages, always in this order: **Stage 1 Planning -> Stage 2 Execution -> Stage 3 Reporting**. Hand off afterwards to the skills that own Stage 4, 5 and 6.

The same three-stage pipeline runs in every mode. Only the entry point and the bookkeeping differ: one ticket at a time (single-ticket), or N tickets managed by a framework file (batch-sprint).

---

## Dependencies

Requires `agentic-qa-core`. Loads on demand:

- `agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md` — **MANDATORY before designing any ATP / TC coverage from acceptance criteria.** Governs the 5 principles, the floor-not-ceiling coverage model, the 1:N explode-default rule, and the formal-technique triggers.
- `agentic-qa-core/references/defect-management-doctrine.md` — **MANDATORY before taking a Story into testing and before filing any Bug / Defect / Improvement.** Governs issue-type classification (Bug vs Defect vs Improvement by feature lifecycle), the QA-Assignee self-assign + never-overwrite rule, mandatory Components, the three-axis model (parent = QA process epic · link = source Story · components = product module), and Severity→Priority auto-derive.
- `agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md`, `./dispatch-patterns.md`, `./orchestration-doctrine.md`, `./session-management.md`, `./preflight-gate.md`, `./adr-doctrine.md` — cited inline by the sections that use them.

## Compact Rules

**Test-design doctrine (binding — full canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md`):**

- AC-pass is the FLOOR, not the goal. Coverage = AC-conformance + risk-beyond-AC (boundaries, errors, states, anomalies). Never report "% of ACs verified" as completeness.
- 1:N is the default: explode every non-trivial AC into multiple cases (EP partitions + boundaries + states + contexts). Collapsing an AC to one case requires a written "trivially atomic" justification.
- Apply techniques by trigger: EP always; BVA wherever a range / limit / length / date-window exists; State-Transition for stateful entities; Decision Table when 2+ conditions interact; Pairwise when 3+ combinable factors (log the reduction); Error-Guessing charters for experience-based risk.
- A criterion is a business assertion; a test case is a concrete exploration of it. Run the Test-Design Checklist before finalizing the ATP.

**Defect-management doctrine (binding — full canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/defect-management-doctrine.md`):**

- CLASSIFY before filing — stop hardcoding "Bug". **Bug** = affected feature already live above Staging (end-user visible); **Defect** = feature still pre-release (Staging or below), the normal output of sprint testing; **Improvement** = not a broken AC (an enhancement, or an under-specified/absent AC surfaced by a test-beyond-AC). Classification follows the FEATURE's lifecycle stage, not where the problem was found (Part 1).
- `qa_assignee` (`{{jira.qa_assignee}}`) = the authenticated session user (self-assign). Set it when a Story is TAKEN INTO TESTING (start_testing) and on every filed Bug / Defect / Improvement. NEVER-OVERWRITE an existing owner (read-before-write); distinct from the native dev `assignee` (Part 2).
- `components` (native, MANDATORY) = the affected product module/Epic, must pre-exist in the Jira Components module (Part 3).
- Three-axis model: **parent** = QA Defect Management process epic (`qa.qa_epics.defect_epic`, found-or-created — NEVER a product/dev epic, NEVER the Story); **issue link** = the source Story (traceability); **components** = product module (Part 4).
- `priority` (native) is auto-derived from `{{jira.severity}}` (critica→Highest, mayor→High, moderada→Medium, menor→Low, trivial→Lowest); override with a 1-line justification (Part 5.1).

**Sprint-testing operational rules:**

- Three stages, always in order: Stage 1 Planning → Stage 2 Execution → Stage 3 Reporting. Hand off Stages 4/5/6 to `test-documentation` / `test-automation` / `regression-testing`.
- Jira is source of truth. Read tickets via `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments`, then the synced `.md`. NEVER `acli workitem view` for custom fields (returns `null`).
- Bugs run the veto + triage + risk-score decision tree BEFORE any ATP is written.
- Execution = smoke pass first, then trifuerza (UI/API/DB) exploration; capture evidence under the PBI folder.
- API testing = three-tool maneuver: OpenAPI MCP for schema (READ-ONLY) → `bun run api:login` for the token (→ `.auth/tokens.env`) → **curl** for authenticated requests. NEVER execute via the OpenAPI MCP. Canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/api-testing-doctrine.md`.
- Consult `domain-glossary.md` (if present) before authoring the ATP, refined ACs, and TC outlines.
- On any subagent failure: STOP, report partial state, offer retry / skip-stage / abort. No auto-fix, no auto-rollback.

**Read full SKILL.md when**: starting a sprint cold, resuming a session, or handling a bug-triage / batch-sprint flow not covered by the rules above.

---

## Inputs — read these first, in this order

Canonical reading order for any AI starting cold on a sprint-testing workflow. Read in order; stop earlier when the ticket is small enough that later inputs add no signal.

1. `.agents/project.yaml` — project identity, env URLs, `{{PROJECT_KEY}}`, MCP names, active environment.
2. `.agents/jira-required.yaml` — canonical slug catalog (custom fields, statuses, transitions) for the active workspace.
3. `.agents/jira-fields.json` — slug → numeric custom-field-ID mapping for `{{jira.<slug>}}` resolution at runtime.
4. `.agents/jira-workflows.json` — workflow + transition catalog (resolves Ready For QA → In Testing → Tested for Story / Bug / Test Case work types).
5. `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/context.md` — ticket-local context: session notes, open questions (hand-authored; read if it already exists from a prior Session Start). NON-Jira file — never a Jira mirror.
6. `.context/master-test-plan.md` — regression Epic pointer, modality decision (Xray vs Jira-native), what to test and why.
7. `.context/business/business-feature-map.md` — feature catalog vocabulary; resolves "what epic owns this story" for the `epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/` PBI folder naming (module = Epic, 1:1).
8. `.context/business/domain-glossary.md` (if present) — canonical domain vocabulary; consult BEFORE authoring the ATP, refined ACs, and TC outlines so test names, entity terms, and Gherkin wording use canonical terms and avoid anti-glossary banned terms. If a new or ambiguous term surfaces during testing, flag it in the Stage 3 QA comment for the PM to add via the glossary's change protocol — NEVER edit the glossary from a testing session.
9. The Story or Bug ticket itself — AC, ATP, comments — read via `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments`, then read the synced `.md` files (`story.md`, `acceptance-criteria.md`, `acceptance-test-plan.md`, `comments.md`) under the STORY folder. Jira is source-of-truth; the synced `.md` is a read-only cache. NEVER `acli workitem view` for custom fields — it returns `null`.
10. `.env` — `LOCAL_USER_*` / `STAGING_USER_*` credentials. NEVER hardcode; always read at runtime.
11. `kata-manifest.json` — registry of existing KATA Components + ATCs. Check before proposing new ATCs in Stage 3 hand-off so the test-automation phase doesn't duplicate work.

**Optional inputs.** `master-test-plan.md`, the business maps, and `domain-glossary.md` frequently arrive after `/project-discovery` runs and may be absent — proceed without them and surface a `missing_input` note in the Stage 1 ATP so a later pass can fill the gap. `kata-manifest.json` is only load-bearing at the Stage 3 → `test-automation` hand-off; skip in pure manual-QA invocations.

## Subagent Dispatch Strategy

> **Orchestration & Session contracts**: this skill follows `./orchestration-doctrine.md` (mandatory subagent dispatch — main thread is command center) AND `./session-management.md` (Phase 0 resume check, plan-first persistence at `.session/<skill-slug>/<scope>/`, archive on completion). Phase 0 (resume check) and Phase 1 (plan write) are NOT optional. The orchestrator also applies the per-stage **Definition-of-Done gates** in `./stage-gates.md`: verify a stage's DoD (planning stages include the Test-Design Checklist) BEFORE recording its progress checkpoint and advancing.

This skill scopes per ticket. Single-ticket mode: `<scope>` = `<JIRA-KEY>` (e.g. `UPEX-123`). Batch-sprint mode: `<scope>` = `sprint-<N>/<JIRA-KEY>` (one nested directory per ticket in the wave). Session state lives at `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/{plan.md, progress.md}` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §3 + §9. The per-ticket `test-session-memory.md` is a SEPARATE concern: it carries TMS modality + ticket context + stage state shared across the 4 sub-agent dispatches (domain memory). Both files coexist — `plan.md` indexes the session; `test-session-memory.md` holds the cross-stage shared payload.

This skill is compliant with the doctrine in `CLAUDE.md` §"Orchestration Mode (Subagent Strategy)" and the session contract in `.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md`. Every dispatch follows the 6-component briefing format defined in `.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md`, and the pattern selected per stage matches the decision guide in `.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/dispatch-patterns.md`. This skill operates in two modes (single-ticket and batch-sprint) and BOTH modes use the same four dispatch points per ticket — Session Start -> Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Stage 3. The only difference is that batch mode loops them once per ticket. The full briefings (Goal / Context docs / Skills to load / Exact instructions / Report format / Rules) live in `references/sprint-orchestration.md` §"Sub-agent prompt templates".

| Stage                                              | Pattern    | Subagent role                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Session Start (per-ticket)                         | Single     | dispatch a session-start subagent: fetch ticket from issue tracker, load `.context/`, create the PBI folder + `context.md` + `test-session-memory.md`, return ticket summary + AC list |
| Stage 1 — Planning (ATP + draft TCs + risk triage) | Sequential | dispatch a Planning subagent: produce the ATP artifact + risk score + draft TC outlines; bug tickets get the veto + triage decision tree applied                                |
| Stage 2 — Execution (smoke + UI/API/DB exploration)| Sequential | dispatch an Execution subagent: smoke pass first, then triforce (UI/API/DB) exploration; capture evidence under the PBI folder; surface BUG_FOUND if applicable                  |
| Stage 3 — Reporting (ATR + QA comment + transition)| Sequential | dispatch a Reporting subagent: fill the ATR, post the QA comment, transition the issue, file bug reports if any                                                                 |

> **Modes are equivalent in dispatch shape**. Single-ticket mode runs ONE pass through these four dispatches. Batch mode loops them per ticket. There is no longer a "single-ticket inline" path — both modes pay the same 4-dispatch cost so behavior is uniform and reviews are consistent.

> **Sequential, not Parallel**: each stage feeds the next (Session Start's PBI folder is read by Stage 1; Stage 1's ATP is read by Stage 2; Stage 2's evidences are read by Stage 3). Parallelism inside a single ticket would race on shared PBI state.

> **On any subagent failure**: STOP, report the partial state (which stages completed, what artifacts landed), present retry / skip-stage / abort options. Do NOT auto-fix nor auto-rollback. See `.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/orchestration-doctrine.md`.

## Scope — pick the mode first

| Mode | Input | Output | Use when |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Single ticket — User Story** | One story ID (e.g. `{{PROJECT_KEY}}-123`) | ATP + ATR + QA comment + ticket moved to {{jira.status.story.qa_approved}}. TC artifacts depend on modality: jira-native → outlines only (regression TCs created in Stage 4); jira-xray → created + executed `Test`s this sprint, promoted to regression in Stage 4 (see "TC creation timing") | Full QA on one story end to end |
| **Single ticket — Bug** | One bug ID | Triage decision, then either Code-Review-only OR ATP + ATR + verification report | Retesting a bug fix on staging |
| **Batch sprint** | `SPRINT-{N}-TESTING.md` framework file | Per-ticket artifacts + updated framework file + session summary | Processing a whole sprint backlog, with interruption + resume support |

Rules for picking:

1. Story ID with status Ready-for-QA -> Single ticket / User Story.
2. Bug ID deployed to staging -> Single ticket / Bug.
3. Sprint number, "process sprint X", or an existing `SPRINT-{N}-TESTING.md` -> Batch sprint.
4. If the framework file does not exist yet, generate it first (see `sprint-orchestration.md`).

---

## Workflow — one pipeline for all modes

```
Session Start (always first)
    -> PBI folder + context.md + test-session-memory.md
    -> Story explanation, WAIT for user OK

Stage 1 — Planning
    -> For Story: triage risk + Test Analysis + ATP/ATR + TC OUTLINES (names + 1-line precond/expected)
                  jira-native -> NO `Test` work items here (created in Stage 4, regression-worthy only)
                  jira-xray   -> CREATE + EXECUTE `Test` issues for the planned outlines at executable
                                 detail, run via a Test Execution (Xray plugin design). Stage 4 promotes
                                 the regression-worthy ones into the Regression Test Plan.
    -> For Bug:   veto check + Bug Analysis + ATP/ATR (no TCs in-sprint — the bug IS the immediate
                  retest case). If regression-worthy, Stage 4 ensures a persistent Test covers it —
                  REUSE the existing failed Test or CREATE one (golden rule; both modalities).
    -> See references/acceptance-test-planning.md and references/feature-test-planning.md
    -> TC work-item timing rule -> see "TC creation timing (modality-aware)" below

Stage 2 — Execution
    -> Smoke test is always first (Go / No-Go)
    -> Then UI / API / DB exploration per what changed
    -> Evidence into .context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/evidence/
    -> See references/exploration-patterns.md

Stage 3 — Reporting
    -> Fill ATR, post QA comment, transition ticket
    -> File bugs via bug-report template when found
    -> See references/reporting-templates.md

---> Hand off (cross-skill, NOT this skill):
       Stage 4 -> test-documentation
       Stage 5 -> test-automation

### TC creation timing (modality-aware) — AUTHORITATIVE

> Resolves the one question that decides this skill's whole shape: *when does a test case become a work item in the TMS?* Guiding principle: **a test is persisted into the REGRESSION repository because it will be re-executed (manual or automated), never to hit a count.** The mechanism differs by modality because the TMS tools differ — an Xray `Test` issue is an **execution unit**, a Jira-native `Test` issue is **documentation**.

**Key distinction:** an **execution artifact** (how you run + record a test this sprint) is NOT the **regression repository** (the curated set of repeatable tests). The principle governs the repository, not the sprint execution artifacts.

| | **Modality jira-native** | **Modality jira-xray** (`bun xray` CLI) |
|---|---|---|
| Stage 1 (Planning) | TC **outlines only** (names + 1-line precond/expected in the ATP). **No `Test` work items** — a native `Test` issue IS documentation, so it waits for the Stage-4 regression-worthy gate. | **ASK the format once per batch** (see "Test-case format — ask once per batch" below), then **create + execute** Xray `Test` issues for the **planned outlines**, at *executable* detail (preconditions + runnable steps), and run them via a **Test Execution** — all in one pass. By Xray's plugin design the `Test` is the execution unit, so generating these artifacts is what makes the rest of the Xray flow work. **Manual** tests are created **without inline steps**, then steps are added one-by-one (see "Manual Xray test steps — two-step creation"). |

#### Test-case format — ask once per batch (Modality jira-xray, Stage 1) — AUTHORITATIVE

Before creating the batch of Xray `Test` issues, **ASK THE USER ONCE PER BATCH** which test-case format to use, and apply the chosen format to **the whole batch**:

- **Manual** — Xray `type=Manual`; step / data / expected-result steps (human-readable, no Gherkin).
- **Gherkin / Cucumber** — Xray `type=Cucumber`; Scenario / Scenario Outline + Examples.

Default *suggestion* (the user still picks): **Gherkin** for automation-candidate flows, **Manual** for exploratory / human-judgment scenarios. State the suggestion, then wait for the user's choice — do not auto-pick. This Stage-1 ask is a sprint-execution convenience; it does NOT pre-empt the Stage-4 ROI verdict→format mapping in `test-documentation` (Candidate→Gherkin, Manual→Manual), which governs the **persistent regression** repository.

#### Manual Xray test steps — two-step creation (Modality jira-xray) — AUTHORITATIVE

Xray Cloud **silently drops** steps passed inline to `test create`. So whenever the batch format is **Manual**, create each Test in **two steps**, never inline:

1. **Create** the `Test` (`type=Manual`) WITHOUT inline steps — `[TMS_TOOL] Create Test: type=Manual, title=...` (no `steps=`).
2. **Add each step one-by-one** via `[TMS_TOOL] Add Test Step` (action / data / expected per step) — the `/xray-cli` skill carries the concrete CLI syntax.

Optionally **verify** with `[TMS_TOOL] Get Test` that the steps landed. Gherkin/Cucumber Tests are unaffected (the Gherkin is one field) — this two-step rule applies to **Manual** tests only.
| Stage 2 (Execution) | Run planned outlines **+ explore beyond them**; track outline status (PASS/FAIL) in `test-session-memory.md`. | Execute the created Tests in the Test Execution; **explore beyond them**. A throwaway exploratory probe becomes a `Test` ONLY if it found a defect or is worth repeating — otherwise it stays as session evidence / a bug, NOT a `Test` (avoid one-shot-Test explosion). |
| Stage 4 (`test-documentation`) | **Create** `Test` work items **only for regression-worthy** scenarios (Candidate/Manual) after ROI; apply the feature/Epic label (native's organizer — no Test Set entity). Deferred → report only, no TMS `Test`. | **Select + promote**: from the sprint Xray Tests, the regression-worthy ones (Candidate/Manual) get **enriched** (rich Gherkin, parameterization, edge elaboration), **labelled** `regression-candidate`, **added to the feature Test Set** (1:1 Epic, created lazily if missing) **and the Regression Test Plan**. Deferred sprint Tests stay tied to their Test Execution as historical record — **not promoted, not deleted**. |

**Invariants (both modalities):**
- The **persistent regression set** is ROI-gated in Stage 4, never assumed in Stage 1.
- The wide 1:N technique derivation feeds the ATP outlines + execution — in native it stays as outlines; in Xray it materializes as sprint `Test` artifacts. Either way it does NOT auto-populate the regression repository.
- Heavy specification ("specify much more") is spent only on Stage-4 regression candidates, never on Deferred scenarios.

See `agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md` (derive widely) + `test-documentation` Three-Outcomes (persist narrowly).
       Stage 6 -> regression-testing
```

Session-start is the universal entry. **Single-ticket mode runs the same 4 dispatches as batch mode**: Session Start -> Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Stage 3. The orchestrator dispatches them sequentially (each subagent's report feeds the next briefing's "Context docs"). The full briefings live in `references/sprint-orchestration.md`. Use them verbatim — do NOT inline any stage just because there is only one ticket. Batch mode loops these same four dispatches through Wave 1 PENDING tickets in the framework file and updates the framework file after each ticket.

---

## Readiness Preflight Gate (MANDATORY — runs before Phase 0)

> Full doctrine: `agentic-qa-core/references/preflight-gate.md`. Runs FIRST, before the resume check. Two laws: (1) **args-as-answers** — "QA UPEX-123 on staging" already answers env + scope; "test the login API" already answers the surface (API). Ask only the gaps. (2) **probe, don't assume** — a configured MCP is RED until it actually answers. Surface gaps + REDs as ONE `AskUserQuestion` checklist; self-fix with approval + explanation; STOP on any blocking RED. This is the heaviest gate in the repo because Stage 2 exercises UI + API + DB live. **Generic baseline** (env resolution, test-user creds, secret/restart handling, the two laws, output contract) is inherited from the reference §3.1 — not repeated here. Below is only this skill's **specific capability delta**.

| Capability | Need | Why here |
|---|---|---|
| Framework adapted (artifacts present) | REQUIRED | Live QA needs the project wired — `{{WEB_URL}}` / MCP names are `null` on a generic boilerplate. Probe the reference §4 ADAPTED signals; still generic → STOP and tell the user to run `/project-discovery` → `/adapt-framework` themselves. The gate NEVER auto-runs them. |
| Active env reachable | REQUIRED | Authoring an ATP against a dead env is the highest-cost waste. Probe `{{WEB_URL}}` + `{{API_URL}}` root. This subsumes the env half of Session Start §0.6 — pulled to t=0. |
| Test-user credentials + roles | REQUIRED | `<<ACTIVE_ENV>>` creds in `.env`. Ask how many roles the ticket needs; one token per role via `scripts/api-login.ts`. |
| Issue-tracker (`[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]`) + TMS modality | REQUIRED | All ATP/ATR/QA-comment/transition writes go to Jira. Load `/acli`; resolve modality; load `/xray-cli` + `XRAY_*` if jira-xray. |
| OpenAPI MCP (schema read-only) | SCOPE — when API surface is in scope | The `openapi` MCP is **schema-read-only** — discover endpoints + read schemas (`list-api-endpoints` / `get-api-endpoint-schema`); it does NOT execute authenticated requests. Probe that a schema call returns the spec. Generic/unset spec → `/adapt-framework`. Execution is curl's job (next row). |
| API token for curl (`bun run api:login`) | SCOPE — when API execution is in scope | Authenticated requests run via **curl**, not the MCP. Mint: `bun run api:login [<env>] [--role <role>]` → `.auth/tokens.env`. Execute: `source .auth/tokens.env && curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN_<ROLE>_<ENV>" "$API_BASE_URL/<path>"`. **No restart needed** (the token never enters an MCP). Canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/api-testing-doctrine.md`. |
| DBHub MCP | SCOPE — when DB validation is in scope | The trifuerza DB leg. Probe `dbhub` lists schema/tables; `DBHUB_*` in `.env`. Unset → user fills `.env` + RESTART (spawn-time). |
| Playwright / `/playwright-cli` | SCOPE — when UI surface is in scope | Smoke + UI exploration. Browser present (`bun run pw:install` if not). |
| Email (`resend`) — can RECEIVE | SCOPE — magic-link / auth-token tickets only | Subsumes the inbox half of Session Start §0.6. A send-only provider cannot complete a magic-link flow → STOP before Stage 1. |
| `kata-manifest.json` | OPTIONAL | Only load-bearing at the Stage 3 → `/test-automation` handoff (anti-duplication). |

Surfaces (UI / API / DB / code-review-only) are decided by **Stage 1 Planning's triage + veto + risk-scoring** — NEVER asked of the user (reference §5). The gate only probes and reports which surface tools are ready; Stage 1 reads that report and picks the trifuerza subset on its own. A scope-conditional tool stays REQUIRED only once Stage 1 selects its surface — if RED then, surface the remedy at that point. Session Start §0.6 stays as written — this gate is its t=0 generalization, not a replacement. After the gate clears (generic baseline + any already-evident surface tools GREEN), continue to Phase 0 below.

---

## Phase 0 — Session resume check (MANDATORY, inline)

Before Session Start dispatch, run the resume contract from `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §4:

1. Compute prospective `<scope>` from invocation: `<JIRA-KEY>` (single-ticket) or `sprint-<N>/<JIRA-KEY>` (batch — once per ticket in the wave loop).
2. Check `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/progress.md`.
3. If it does NOT exist → proceed to Session Start (writes `plan.md`).
4. If it DOES exist:
   - Read `plan.md` + tail of `progress.md`.
   - Optionally read `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/test-session-memory.md` for the per-ticket domain state (load-bearing across the 4 sub-agent dispatches).
   - Surface to the user: last completed stage (Session Start / Stage 1 / Stage 2 / Stage 3) + next stage + any unresolved BUG_FOUND or TOOL FAILURE from the last entry.
   - Offer **resume / restart / abort**. On `restart`, archive to `.session/.archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-sprint-testing-<scope>-aborted/` first.

Batch-sprint mode: Phase 0 fires once per ticket as the loop enters it (NOT once at sprint-loop entry). Per-ticket resume keeps batch progress fine-grained.

---

## Session Start — the universal entry

Every invocation starts by initializing the session, even in batch mode. Session Start:

0. **Resolve TMS modality** (Xray on Jira vs Jira-native). By excellence ATP/ATR are real Jira items — a `Test Plan` issue (`ATP: {STORY-KEY}: {story title}`) parented to the **QA Master Test Plan** epic, and a `Test Execution` issue (`ATR: {STORY-KEY}: Story Testing`) parented to the **QA Test Artifacts** epic; the Story custom-field + comment mirror (Modality jira-native) is a **fallback ONLY** when those work types are unavailable. The modality probe decides which path is live. Title grammar + epic parenting + the Feature-altitude FTP/FTR names: `references/acceptance-test-planning.md`. Full resolution algorithm lives in `test-documentation/SKILL.md` §Phase 0 — apply the same four-step probe here (CLAUDE.md -> master-test-plan.md -> list issue types -> ask the user). Persist the result into `test-session-memory.md`.
0.1. **Load required tool skills** — based on the TMS modality resolved in Step 0:
   - Always load `/acli` (Jira WRITE operations: comment, transition, link, custom-field update, bug creation). Detailed READS (ACs, ATP/ATR, description, comments) do NOT use `/acli` — they use `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments` then read the synced `.md`. See `agentic-qa-core/references/acli-integration.md` §"Reads vs writes".
   - In **Modality jira-xray**: also load `/xray-cli` for Test / Test Execution / Test Plan / Test Run operations and traceability reads.
   - In **Modality jira-native**: `/acli` covers `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` writes and `[TMS_TOOL]` operations — no additional skill needed. Detailed reads still route through the sync script.
   This step is **mandatory before any pseudocode block below executes**. The skills carry the concrete syntax, flags, and JSON payloads this skill intentionally omits.
0.5. **Sprint roadmap checkpoint** (batch-sprint mode only — skip in single-ticket mode):
   - Detect batch mode from the user invocation ("process sprint N", "continue sprint", a `sprint-file` parameter, or any phrase that implies a sprint loop).
   - Check whether `.context/reports/SPRINT-{N}-TESTING.md` exists for the target sprint.
     - **Missing** -> generate it before entering the ticket loop. Delegate to `sprint-orchestration.md` §Part 1 — Sprint Roadmap Generator.
     - **Present but older than 24h, OR the user explicitly asks for a refresh** -> regenerate (warn + confirm overwrite).
     - **Present and fresh** -> proceed.
   - Single-ticket and bug-only invocations skip this step entirely — they do not need a roadmap file.
0.6. **Environment + inbox preflight** (orchestrator-inline, blocking gate — runs BEFORE Stage 1 authors any ATP):
   - Probe the active environment for reachability: a generic HTTP request to `{{WEB_URL}}` and `{{API_URL}}` root (HEAD or GET, e.g. `curl -sI {{WEB_URL}}`). Expect a 2xx/3xx (a login redirect counts as reachable). A hard failure on root — 404 / 410 / 5xx, connection refused, or a dead-deployment page (`DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND` etc.) — means the env is not testable.
   - On hard failure: **STOP and surface to the user before Stage 1.** Do NOT dispatch the Session Start subagent and do NOT author an ATP against a dead env — that is the single highest-cost waste in a run. Offer the user a session env override (see Gotcha 15) if they have a working alternate URL.
   - **Inbox receive-check** (only when the ticket is email / magic-link / auth-token dependent — inferred from the invocation, ticket type, labels, or title): confirm the configured mailbox/provider can actually *receive*, not just send. A send-only provider (e.g. a domain configured for outbound only) cannot complete a magic-link flow. If it cannot receive, STOP and surface before Stage 1.
   - This is a *reachability* gate (is the env even up? can we get the email?), distinct from the Stage 2 smoke test (does the *feature* work?). Both run; they answer different questions — keep anti-pattern S7 and the smoke pass as-is.
1. Fetches the ticket via `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments` (title, ACs, priority, comments), then reads the synced `.md` files under the STORY folder. NEVER `acli workitem view` for custom fields.
2. Extracts Team Discussion from the synced `comments.md` (decisions, tech notes, edge cases, blockers). Non-blocking.
3. Loads the project-wide context files: `.context/business/business-data-map.md`, `.context/business/business-feature-map.md`, `.context/business/business-api-map.md`, `.context/master-test-plan.md`.
4. Loads or creates `module-context.md` (3-level hierarchy: project -> module -> ticket).
5. Explores backend (`{{BACKEND_REPO}}`) + frontend (`{{FRONTEND_REPO}}`) code.
6. Finds test data candidates via `[DB_TOOL]` on `{{DB_MCP}}`.
7. Creates the PBI folder and files:
   ```
   .context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-{{PROJECT_KEY}}-{number}-{brief-title}/
     context.md                # hand-authored: session notes + open questions (NON-Jira)
     test-session-memory.md    # hand-authored: shared memory across the 4 sub-agent dispatches (NON-Jira)
     evidence/                 # screenshots, gitignored
   ```
   Jira-mirrored files (`story.md`, `acceptance-criteria.md`, `acceptance-test-plan.md`, `acceptance-test-results.md`, `comments.md`, etc.) are NOT hand-written here — they are materialized by `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments`.
8. **Writes the session `plan.md`** at `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/plan.md` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §6 — Goal (one sentence per ticket), Inputs (PBI paths + TMS modality + Team Discussion summary), Approach (mode + per-stage dispatch pattern), Phase breakdown (Session Start / Stage 1 / Stage 2 / Stage 3 with dispatch pointer + exit condition), Risks (from triage), Verification checklist, Cross-references (cites `context.md`, `test-session-memory.md`, `acceptance-test-plan.md`, `acceptance-test-results.md`).
9. Writes a Story Explanation and **STOPS** for user confirmation. Do not proceed until the user OK's.
10. After OK, appends the first progress entry `## Session Start — <ts>` with `status: completed`, `next: Stage 1 — Planning` to `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/progress.md`.

Details, templates and error table live in `references/session-entry-points.md`.

## Mode branches — what changes after Session Start

> Both single-ticket and batch modes run the SAME 4-dispatch cadence (Session Start -> Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Stage 3) per ticket. Use the briefings in `references/sprint-orchestration.md` §"Sub-agent prompt templates" verbatim — do NOT inline a stage just because there is only one ticket. The previous "single-ticket inline" path is **REMOVED**. The notes below describe only what is *different* per ticket type or per mode (TMS payload shape, framework-file update timing, etc.). The dispatch sequence itself is invariant.

### Single-ticket, User Story (Stages 1 -> 2 -> 3)

Run the same 4 dispatches. Per-stage payload differences:

- Stage 1 (per "TC creation timing"): Triage risk -> Test Analysis -> ATP/ATR -> **jira-native**: TC **outlines** only, no `Test` work items; **jira-xray**: ask the TC format once per batch (Manual vs Gherkin), then **create + execute** `Test` issues for the planned outlines at executable detail via a Test Execution (Manual tests = create-then-add-step, per "Manual Xray test steps — two-step creation"). Persistent regression TCs are created (native) / promoted (xray) in Stage 4. **Traceability (jira-xray)**: link the **Story only to its ATP and ATR** ("is tested by"); link each created **TC to the ATP (designed-by) and the ATR (executed-by)** — do NOT link TCs directly to the Story (see Gotcha #9). Verify with `[TMS_TOOL] trace`.
- Stage 2: Smoke test -> UI / API / DB exploration **beyond the planned outlines** -> update outline status (native) or Test runs in the Test Execution (xray) PASSED / FAILED -> fold any newly-discovered partition/boundary/transition back into the outline set; an exploratory probe becomes a `Test` only if it found a defect or is worth repeating -> file bugs if any.
- Stage 3: Author ATR Test Report -> apply the modality branch (reporting-templates.md §2.3-2.4): Modality jira-native -> write the `{{jira.acceptance_test_results}}` field (or `## Acceptance Test Results (ATR)` fallback comment) then `jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments` -> `acceptance-test-results.md` in the STORY folder; Modality jira-xray -> update the Test Execution then `jira:sync-issues get <ATR_KEY>` -> `.context/PBI/test-executions/TESTEXEC-<ATR_KEY>-<slug>.md` -> QA comment via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` -> transition ticket.
- **Per-stage progress checkpoint**: after each Stage subagent returns, the orchestrator appends a phase entry to `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/progress.md` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §7 (`status: completed`, `dispatched_as: Sequential`, `next: Stage <N+1> | hand-off`).
- **Archive after Stage 3**: when Stage 3 completes (or veto-skip Code-Review variant finishes), the orchestrator moves `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/` to `.session/.archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-sprint-testing-<scope>/` and calls `mem_session_summary` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §8. PBI artifacts under `.context/PBI/` stay.
- Afterwards: hand off to `test-documentation` for ROI + Stage 4.

### Single-ticket, Bug (Triage -> Verify -> Report)

Run the same 4 dispatches; the Stage 1 briefing additionally applies the veto + risk-score decision tree before producing the ATP.

- Triage: veto table (see Gotchas) -> if SKIP, run Code-Review workflow and finish (Stage 2 + Stage 3 dispatches collapse to the in-place comment + transition; the orchestrator skips them only if the Stage 1 subagent reports `veto_outcome: skip`).
- Risk score only if no veto applies. 0-3 LOW, 4-7 MEDIUM (ask user), 8+ HIGH.
- Create ATP + ATR, no TCs in-sprint (the bug is the immediate retest case). Fill Bug Analysis inside the ATP. **Regression follow-up**: if the bug is regression-worthy, Stage 4 (`test-documentation` bug-driven decision) ensures a persistent Test covers it — reuse the existing failed Test or create one (golden rule). Not every bug qualifies; a one-time typo in a stable area is treated like a failed test.
- Execute: reproduce original bug -> verify fix -> regression pass on adjacent areas -> DB cross-validation if data-integrity bug.
- Report: update ATR, post comment (Template C PASSED or Template D FAILED), provide 1-2 evidence screenshot paths to the user.

### Batch sprint

- Pre-step: generate `SPRINT-{N}-TESTING.md` from the sprint backlog if it does not exist (see `sprint-orchestration.md`).
- Loop: read Wave 1 for the first `PENDING` ticket, dispatch the same 4-stage sequence per ticket, after each ticket update the framework file + present a per-ticket summary + wait for user OK.
- **Interrupted session resume**: on loop entry per ticket, Phase 0 reads `.session/sprint-testing/sprint-<N>/<TICKET>/progress.md` (canonical resume signal per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §4). Domain state for an in-flight ticket is in `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/test-session-memory.md` (load-bearing for the 4 sub-agent dispatches). The two files serve different concerns: `progress.md` decides "which stage is next?"; `test-session-memory.md` carries the per-ticket payload that each sub-agent reads. Both are checked.
- After each stage subagent returns, the orchestrator appends a phase entry to `progress.md` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §7. After Stage 3 completes, the orchestrator runs Archive: moves `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/` to `.session/.archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-sprint-testing-<scope>/` and calls `mem_session_summary`. The PBI artifacts under `.context/PBI/` and the framework file `SPRINT-{N}-TESTING.md` stay in place — those are the canonical deliverables.
- Stop on TOOL FAILURE. Pause on BUG_FOUND. Update framework file ONLY after Stage 3 completes.

## Gotchas — inline rules you must apply every invocation

1. **Credentials**: always from `.env`. Never hardcode. Never guess passwords.
2. **PBI folder naming**: canonical layout is `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/` (module = Epic, 1:1). `<slug>` is max 5 words, kebab-case, AI-generated from the ticket title. Epic-level files live in the EPIC folder; story-level files in the STORY folder.
3. **Bugs get ATP + ATR, no TCs in-sprint**. The bug ticket is the implicit *immediate* test case; reproduction steps = test steps. But a regression-worthy bug MUST end with a persistent Test in Stage 4 — reuse the existing failed Test or create one (golden rule). Not every bug qualifies.
4. **Smoke test is mandatory** as the first action in Stage 2. If smoke fails (No-Go), stop and report — do not proceed to deep exploration. Smoke failure is an env-level blocker and always stops; deep-exploration findings follow the graduated rule in #10 (a FAIL mid-pass is not auto-Critical).
5. **Bug veto table — SKIP retesting** when the bug is pure text / CSS / docs / config / tech-debt cleanup with no functional change. **REQUIRE retesting** regardless of score when it touches money, data integrity, auth, external integrations, state machines, or calculations. Veto beats risk score.
6. **TCs are created in Stage 1, NEVER in Stage 2**. Stage 2 executes what Planning produced; new TCs found during exploration are added via `[TMS_TOOL] tc create` but the rule is "planning first".
7. **Explain the story -> WAIT for OK**. Never auto-proceed past Session Start without user confirmation. Same for bug triage — present the decision and wait.
8. **Evidence directory**: always configure `.playwright/cli.config.json` `outputDir` to `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/evidence/` BEFORE using `[AUTOMATION_TOOL]`. Screenshots need the full path in `--filename` because `outputDir` does not apply to `.png`.
9. **Traceability check after Stage 1** (Modality jira-xray): run `[TMS_TOOL] trace {TICKET}` and verify the model — the **Story is linked ONLY to its ATP (Test Plan) and ATR (Test Execution)** as "is tested by". **Individual TCs are NOT linked directly to the Story** (avoids noise); they aggregate via ATP/ATR — the **ATP "designs"** the TCs (TC "is designed by" ATP) and the **ATR "executes"** the TCs (TC "is executed by" ATR). So verify: Story↔ATP, Story↔ATR, each TC↔ATP (designed-by), each TC↔ATR (executed-by) — NOT TC↔Story. Full doctrine: `test-documentation/references/traceability-linking.md` + `tms-architecture.md`. Bugs: traceability "gaps" for missing TCs are expected and OK.
10. **Graduated stop/pause protocol**: TOOL FAILURE -> stop, report, await user. **Blocking** BUG_FOUND (smoke/env down, data integrity, security-exploitable) -> pause, present bug, await decision; NEVER dispatch the next sub-agent while unresolved. **Non-blocking** finding (cosmetic, minor validation, edge-case on a non-critical TC, framework-default pending recalibration) -> the Execution subagent logs it and CONTINUES the pass; the orchestrator surfaces it at Stage 2 close. A FAIL is not auto-Critical — triage first (severity per `references/reporting-templates.md` §1.4; security/auth/framework-default recalibrated at §5.0). See `references/exploration-patterns.md` "Finding triage".
11. **Framework file update timing**: only update `SPRINT-{N}-TESTING.md` AFTER Stage 3 completes and the orchestrator-side checklist verifies. Not earlier.
12. **Language**: all artifacts, TMS content, and commit messages in English. Mirror the user's language only in conversation.
13. **Environment + inbox preflight before ATP**: Session Start §0.6 probes `{{WEB_URL}}` / `{{API_URL}}` for reachability (and, for email/auth-dependent stories, that the inbox can *receive*) BEFORE any ATP/Jira write. A dead env or send-only inbox is caught here with a STOP, not at Stage 2 after the ATP is already authored. Reachability gate ≠ Stage 2 smoke — see S7.
14. **Severity recalibration before blocking a Story**: a Story TC FAIL is NOT automatically a blocking defect. When the failing TC is security/auth/framework-default class (cookie flags, CSP/HSTS headers, SDK-by-design behavior), run the recalibration gate (`references/reporting-templates.md` §5.0) BEFORE firing `{{jira.transition.story.defect_reported}}`/blocked: state the framework-default/mitigation hypothesis, cite one verification fact, surface to the user. A recalibrated finding becomes GO-with-debt (`PASSED WITH ISSUES`), not a blocker. Mechanical path stays the default for ordinary functional FAILs. **Once the gate confirms a real blocking defect and the `defect_reported` → `blocked` transition fires, also create the Story `is blocked by` Bug issuelink** via `{{jira.link_types.blocks.name}}` (the Bug `blocks` the Story) — methodology step in `references/reporting-templates.md` §5.1, mechanics in `agentic-qa-core/references/traceability-linking.md` (§2/§4/§6). The status transition alone does not record the dependency edge.
15. **Session env override**: to test against an ad-hoc URL not in `.agents/project.yaml` (broken staging, ephemeral preview deploy, hotfix branch URL), record it ONCE in `test-session-memory.md` §Environment as `WEB_URL_OVERRIDE` / `API_URL_OVERRIDE`. When set, it beats the `project.yaml` active-env value for every stage and is read automatically by all four dispatches — never re-thread it per briefing, and never write it to `project.yaml` (session-only). Distinct from `active_env` switching, which picks a *named* env from `project.yaml`.
16. **Session-footer contract (mandatory at close)**: the final stage is not done until the two chat-facing blocks from `../agentic-qa-core/references/session-footer-contract.md` are printed: (1) consolidated screenshot list — repo-relative paths, verified on disk, bug annotations first — plus in-flow surfacing of every capture's path the instant it lands; (2) Session Footer listing skills/MCPs/CLIs actually used + testing levels touched, with explicit "none" entries for expected-but-untouched levels. Framing for this skill: execution. Multi-subagent sessions: each stage report carries the five footer fields (`skills_loaded`, `mcps_used`, `clis_used`, `testing_levels_touched`, `screenshots_captured`); the orchestrator compiles the footer ONCE at close. Chat only — never in a Jira comment or ATR body.

## Cross-skill handoff — what this skill does NOT do

| Predecessor | Load this skill | Reason |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Pre-sprint AC refinement on a batch of backlog Stories | `shift-left-testing` | Stage 0. If the Story passed through `/shift-left-testing` and carries label `shift-left-reviewed` with a dated label <30 days old, Stage 1 here short-circuits Phases 1-3 of `acceptance-test-planning.md` and continues from Phase 4. If the Story did NOT pass through Shift-Left, Stage 1 runs all phases in full — but this is more expensive in-sprint than pre-sprint. |

| After Stage 3 you need... | Load this skill | Reason |
|---------------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Formalize TCs in Jira/Xray, calculate ROI, decide Candidate / Manual / Deferred | `test-documentation` | Stage 4. This skill produces the inputs (outlines + execution evidence); `test-documentation` produces the formal regression backlog — creating `Test` work items (jira-native) or creating/promoting them into the Regression Test Plan (jira-xray), regression-worthy scenarios only. |
| Write the automated test code (KATA Page / Api + test file) | `test-automation` | Stage 5. Plan -> Code -> Review pipeline. |
| Run the regression or smoke suite in CI and emit a GO/NO-GO verdict | `regression-testing` | Stage 6. This skill's Stage 2 smoke is local-manual, not the CI suite. |
| Generate `business-data-map.md`, `business-feature-map.md`, `business-api-map.md`, `master-test-plan.md` | `project-discovery` (or the individual `/business-*-map` and `/master-test-plan` commands) | Sprint-testing consumes these; it does not create them. |

If Session Start reports that any of the project-wide context files are missing, stop and hand off to `project-discovery` (or the relevant command). Do not continue without them.

## Pseudocode tags used here

| Tag | Resolves to | Defined in |
|-----|-------------|------------|
| `[TMS_TOOL]` | xray-cli skill, Atlassian MCP, or `{{TMS_CLI}}` | `CLAUDE.md` Tool Resolution |
| `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` | `acli`, Atlassian MCP, or `{{ISSUE_TRACKER_CLI}}` | `CLAUDE.md` Tool Resolution |

> **Reads vs writes split** (per `agentic-qa-core/references/acli-integration.md` §"Reads vs writes"): **detailed reads** of an issue (custom fields, ACs, ATP/ATR, description, comments) use `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments` (or `jql "<query>"`) then read the synced `.md` — NEVER `acli workitem view` (returns `null` for custom fields). **Writes / transitions / links / bug creation / trivial summary-or-status lookups** stay on `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` (`/acli`). **Traceability** (link graph Story↔ATP↔ATR↔TC, Xray run status) stays on `[TMS_TOOL]` / `/acli` / `/xray-cli` — do NOT migrate trace reads to the sync.
| `[AUTOMATION_TOOL]` | playwright-cli skill or Playwright MCP | `CLAUDE.md` Tool Resolution |
| `[DB_TOOL]` | DBHub MCP or Supabase MCP | `CLAUDE.md` Tool Resolution |
| `[API_TOOL]` | Schema read → OpenAPI MCP (read-only); execute → curl (token via `bun run api:login`) | `CLAUDE.md` Tool Resolution + `agentic-qa-core/references/api-testing-doctrine.md` |

Concrete tools (`bun`, `git`, `gh`) are used literally. Project variables like `{{PROJECT_KEY}}`, `{{DB_MCP}}`, `{{WEB_URL}}` are resolved from `.agents/project.yaml` (env-scoped vars resolve to the active environment).

## Anti-patterns — NEVER do these

- **S1.** NEVER mark a Story Ready For Release (or transition to {{jira.status.story.qa_approved}}) without QA sign-off AND a signed-off ATR snapshot for audit trail.
- **S2.** NEVER skip the Stage 1 Test Plan (ATP) step in Modality jira-xray workflows — the Xray `Test Plan` / `Test Execution` issues depend on the ATP being committed first; downstream TCs cannot link without it.
- **S3.** NEVER push test results to Jira without an ATR snapshot. The QA comment is a summary; the ATR is the audit record.
- **S4.** NEVER duplicate the ATR across Jira + Confluence (or any second store). Single source of truth — pick one per the modality decision in `.context/master-test-plan.md` and link from anywhere else.
- **S5.** NEVER bypass the bug-triage decision tree (veto → risk-score → Severity + Root Cause) when a test fails. Every failure gets a triage before it becomes a Bug ticket.
- **S6.** NEVER write ATP / ATR bodies in raw ADF JSON by hand. Use md-to-adf via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` so formatting survives Jira's renderer.
- **S7.** NEVER skip the smoke pass before triforce (UI / API / DB) exploration. Smoke validates the environment; triforce validates the feature. Order matters — a broken env produces false-positive bug reports.
- **S8.** NEVER mix UI + API + DB findings into a single bug ticket. File per layer (or per root-cause cluster) so triage and routing stay clean.
- **S9.** NEVER reuse a PBI folder across tickets. Every Story or Bug gets its own `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/` directory; cross-ticket contamination breaks evidence + traceability.
- **S10.** NEVER transition the ticket Ready For QA → In Testing without explaining the story to the user AND waiting for confirmation (CLAUDE.md §8 — Session Start is not a one-shot, it's a hand-off gate).
- **S11.** NEVER skip the auto-stage promote (Session Start → Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3) after a phase completes — each promote is a checkpoint that writes a `progress.md` entry and feeds the next subagent's Context docs.
- **S12.** NEVER file a bug without a reproducible repro path AND evidence (screenshot, trace, log, network HAR, or DB row reference). "It failed for me once" is not a bug ticket.
- **S13.** NEVER hardcode `customfield_NNNNN` IDs in ATP / ATR / QA comments or in any reference under this skill. Resolve every Jira field via `{{jira.<slug>}}` against `.agents/jira-required.yaml`.
- **S14.** NEVER hand-write a Jira-mirrored `.md` in the PBI folder (`story.md`, `acceptance-criteria.md`, `acceptance-test-plan.md`, `acceptance-test-results.md`, `comments.md`, `feature-test-plan.md`, etc.). To SET their content: author it → write to the Jira custom field via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` (or, when the field is absent, a structured comment per `.agents/jira-required.yaml` `fallback:`) → run `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments` → READ the materialized file. Only `context.md`, `test-session-memory.md`, `module-context.md`, and `evidence/` are hand-authored locally.
- **S15.** NEVER bury a hard-to-reverse test-architecture decision in a ticket plan. If Stage 1 planning forces a decision that is architectural AND hard to reverse (test-data-isolation contract, auth-in-tests change, fixture topology, flake-retry policy spanning 3+ tests or 2+ tickets), promote it to `.context/ADR/ADR-NNNN-<slug>.md` (append-only; supersede, never edit) and leave a `See ADR-NNNN` backlink in the plan's `## Technical Decisions`. Ticket-local trade-offs stay in the plan. AI drafts `Proposed`; the human approves. See `agentic-qa-core/references/adr-doctrine.md` §1–§2.

## Pre-flight checklist

- [ ] Phase 0 — Session resume check ran (read `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/progress.md`); user chose resume / restart / abort if prior state existed
- [ ] Mode picked (single-ticket / bug / batch)
- [ ] Session Start complete, user confirmed the story explanation
- [ ] `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/plan.md` written (per `session-management.md` §6 schema)
- [ ] Project-wide context files present (if missing, hand off to `project-discovery`)
- [ ] PBI folder + `context.md` + `test-session-memory.md` created
- [ ] `.env` credentials loaded (no hardcoded passwords)
- [ ] Bug path: veto table evaluated BEFORE risk score
- [ ] Stage 1 artifacts created with full traceability, verified via `[TMS_TOOL] trace`
- [ ] Stage 2 smoke test executed FIRST, Go/No-Go recorded
- [ ] Evidence captured under the ticket's `evidence/` folder
- [ ] Stage 3 ATR filled + QA comment posted + ticket transitioned
- [ ] Per-stage progress checkpoint appended to `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/progress.md` after each Stage subagent returned
- [ ] Archive: `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/` moved to `.session/.archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-sprint-testing-<scope>/` and `mem_session_summary` called after Stage 3
- [ ] Hand-off identified for Stages 4 / 5 / 6 if applicable
- [ ] Batch mode: framework file updated AFTER Stage 3 only, user OK'd next ticket
- [ ] Session footer + consolidated screenshot list printed in chat per session-footer-contract (never in a Jira comment)
