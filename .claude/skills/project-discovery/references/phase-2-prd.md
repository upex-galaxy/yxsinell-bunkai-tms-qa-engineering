# Phase 2 — PRD Discovery

> Read this when running any Phase 2 PRD sub-step (Executive Summary, User Personas, User Journeys), or when the Phase 2 PRD section of SKILL.md §Phases points here.

Produce the Product Requirements Documents by reading the code, not by interviewing stakeholders. Four docs, produced in order. Each one builds on the previous.

```
1. Executive Summary     -> .context/PRD/executive-summary.md
2. User Personas         -> .context/PRD/user-personas.md
3. User Journeys         -> .context/PRD/user-journeys.md
4. Feature Inventory     -> delegated to /business-feature-map command
                            (output: .context/business/business-feature-map.md)
```

Prereqs (from Phase 1): `.context/business/business-model.md` and `.context/business/domain-glossary.md` must exist. Personas link to roles already identified in the glossary; journeys link to features already identified in the business model.

**Mindset**: product discovery, not product creation. Every claim cites a code or doc source. Aspirational language ("will eventually support") belongs in Discovery Gaps, not in the doc body.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Entry point for anyone learning the product. Must fit in one read.

### Discovery commands

```bash
# Problem + solution
head -80 <repo-root>/README.md
grep -rE "hero|tagline|headline" --include="*.tsx" <repo-root>/src | head -20
cat <repo-root>/src/app/page.tsx <repo-root>/src/pages/index.tsx 2>/dev/null | head -100

# Core features -- navigation + API surface
grep -rE "path\s*:\s*['\"]|href=" --include="*.tsx" <repo-root>/src/components/nav* <repo-root>/src/app/layout* 2>/dev/null
ls <repo-root>/src/app/api <repo-root>/src/pages/api <repo-root>/src/routes 2>/dev/null

# Metrics -- analytics + monitoring
grep -rE "analytics|track|event|metric" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" <repo-root>/src | head -20
grep -E "sentry|datadog|newrelic|prometheus|posthog|amplitude|mixpanel" <repo-root>/package.json

# Target users (feed from Phase 1 glossary + auth code)
grep -rE "role|userType|permission" --include="*.ts" <repo-root>/src/auth <repo-root>/src/middleware 2>/dev/null
```

### Required sections in `.context/PRD/executive-summary.md`

1. **Problem Statement** -- The Challenge (2-3 paragraphs with source quotes) + Current Alternatives (if discoverable).
2. **Solution Overview**
   - Product Vision (one sentence)
   - Core Capabilities table: `# | Feature | Problem Addressed | Evidence (route or component)`
   - Key Differentiators
3. **Success Metrics**
   - Tracked Metrics: `Metric | Type (Adoption/Engagement/Revenue) | Implementation | Source`
   - Inferred KPIs (from features, not real tracking)
   - Unknown Metrics (gaps)
4. **Target Users** -- brief for each persona: System Role + Need + Evidence. Detailed personas go in the next doc.
5. **Product Scope**
   - What's Included (current capabilities)
   - What's Not Included (known limitations)
   - Future Indicators (TODO comments, feature flags, roadmap files)
6. **Discovery Gaps** -- table `Gap | Impact | Suggested Source`.
7. **QA Relevance** -- Critical Testing Areas + Risk Areas.
8. **Document References** -- list of sibling PRD/SRS docs with status.

### Quality rules

- 5 core features max. More than that and the summary becomes useless.
- Tracked Metrics must show the real `track()` / `analytics.event()` call site -- if you only found the SDK import but no usage, it goes under Inferred KPIs.
- Key Differentiators requires real marketing copy or an obvious code mechanism (e.g., "only product that serves X format"). Inventing a differentiator disqualifies the doc.

## 2. User Personas

### Mindset

**In existing products, personas are defined by the code, not by research.** The users you document are the roles the system already recognizes. Do not invent demographic personas; extract system roles and map them to goals that match the permissions they have.

### Discovery commands

```bash
# Role definitions
grep -rE "enum\s+\w*Role|type\s+\w*Role|const\s+[A-Z_]*ROLE" --include="*.ts" <repo-root>/src
grep -rE "hasPermission|canAccess|isAdmin|isOwner|requireAuth" --include="*.ts" <repo-root>/src

# DB role column
grep -A20 "model User" <repo-root>/prisma/schema.prisma 2>/dev/null
grep -rE "role|userType|accountType" <repo-root>/prisma/schema.prisma <repo-root>/drizzle/schema.ts 2>/dev/null

# Middleware / guards
grep -rE "middleware|guard|protect|requireRole" --include="*.ts" <repo-root>/src/middleware <repo-root>/src/guards 2>/dev/null

# Role-based UI rendering
grep -rE "role\s*===|isAdmin|canEdit|hasAccess" --include="*.tsx" <repo-root>/src/components

# Role-specific pages
ls <repo-root>/src/app/admin <repo-root>/src/app/dashboard <repo-root>/src/pages/admin 2>/dev/null

# User profile fields (for attribute discovery)
grep -rE "profile|account|UserProfile|AccountInfo" --include="*.tsx" <repo-root>/src/components | head -20
grep -rE "signup|register" --include="*.tsx" <repo-root>/src | head -20
```

### Required sections in `.context/PRD/user-personas.md`

1. **Persona Discovery Summary** -- single overview table: `Persona | System Role | Access Level | Primary Goal`.
2. **Persona N** (one subsection each; 2-4 personas is typical; do not force a fifth):
   - Identity: System Role (`role_value`) + Evidence file + Access Level + Estimated % of Users.
   - Goals (Inferred from Features): `Goal | Supporting Feature | Route/Component`.
   - Pain Points (Inferred from Validation/Errors): `Pain Point | Evidence` (quote the exact error message).
   - Feature Access: `Feature | Access (Full/Limited/None) | Evidence`.
   - User Journey Summary (one-line ASCII flow).
   - Profile Attributes (from User model schema).
   - Representative Quote (inferred, flagged as such).
3. **Role Hierarchy** -- Mermaid `graph TD` if hierarchy exists.
4. **Permission Matrix** -- `Permission | Role1 | Role2 | Role3 | Role4` with check/cross per cell.
5. **Discovery Gaps** -- `Gap | Why It Matters | Question to Ask`.
6. **QA Relevance**
   - Test Account Requirements: `Persona | Test Account | Permissions Needed`.
   - Critical Persona Flows to Test.
   - Edge Cases by Persona.

### Quality rules

- Fewer is better. Two clean personas beat five speculative ones.
- "Representative Quote" is always flagged "(inferred)" -- it is an illustration, not a datapoint.
- Test Account Requirements must map to `.env` keys (`LOCAL_<ROLE>_EMAIL` / `STAGING_<ROLE>_EMAIL`) when such users exist. If not, flag them as needing creation.

---

## 3. User Journeys

### Mindset

Routes are journey steps. Redirects are transitions. Form submit handlers reveal the next step. Map what the user can actually do, then overlay the personas on each journey.

### Discovery commands

```bash
# Route structure
# Next.js App Router:
find <repo-root>/src/app -name "page.tsx" -o -name "page.ts" | sort
find <repo-root>/src/app -name "layout.tsx"
find <repo-root>/src/app -type d -name "\[*\]"       # dynamic segments

# Next.js Pages Router:
find <repo-root>/src/pages -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" | grep -v "_app\|_document\|api" | sort

# React Router:
grep -rE "<Route\b" --include="*.tsx" <repo-root>/src

# Navigation components
find <repo-root>/src/components -iname "*nav*" -o -iname "*menu*" -o -iname "*sidebar*"
grep -rE "href=|to=" --include="*.tsx" <repo-root>/src/components/layout <repo-root>/src/components/header 2>/dev/null | head -40

# Conditional nav (role-based)
grep -rE "role.*&&|isAdmin.*&&|can.*&&" --include="*.tsx" <repo-root>/src/components

# Multi-step flows
grep -rE "step|wizard|stepper|progress" --include="*.tsx" <repo-root>/src/components
grep -rE "onSubmit.*next|handleNext" --include="*.tsx" <repo-root>/src

# Redirect patterns
grep -rE "redirect\(|router\.(push|replace)" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" <repo-root>/src | head -40
```

### Required sections in `.context/PRD/user-journeys.md`

1. **Route Map** -- three tables:
   - Public Routes (Unauthenticated): `Route | Page | Purpose`.
   - Protected Routes (Authenticated): `Route | Page | Requires (role) | Purpose`.
   - Dynamic Routes: `Pattern | Example | Purpose`.
2. **Journey N** (one per critical flow; 3-5 journeys is ideal):
   - Persona + Goal + Discovered From.
   - Flow Diagram (Mermaid `journey` or `flowchart LR`).
   - Step-by-Step Flow: `Step | Page | Action | Next | Evidence (file:line)`.
   - Error Paths: `Error | Handling | Evidence`.
   - Success Criteria checklist.
3. **Navigation Structure** -- Mermaid `graph LR` grouping Public / Authenticated / Admin subgraphs.
4. **Breadcrumb Patterns** -- `Path | Breadcrumb`.
5. **Critical Paths**
   - Happy Paths (Must Work): `Journey | Start | End | Business Impact`.
   - Unhappy Paths (Must Handle): `Scenario | Expected Behavior | Evidence`.
6. **Discovery Gaps** -- `Flow | Unknown | Question`.
7. **QA Relevance**
   - Critical E2E Test Scenarios: `Priority (P0/P1/P2) | Scenario | Journey Reference`.
   - Suggested Test Data: `Journey | Test User | Prerequisites`.

### Quality rules

- 3-5 journeys is the right number. Fewer means low coverage; more means you are listing every form, not every journey.
- Always include error paths. Happy paths without their unhappy counterparts are incomplete.
- "Evidence" column is required in Step-by-Step Flow. If you cannot cite a file, the step is a guess.
- Do not map journey steps that require user input you have not received (e.g., OTP or 2FA) without flagging them as external-dependency steps.

## 4. Feature Inventory — delegated to `/business-feature-map`

Feature inventory work lives in the `/business-feature-map` command, **not** in this phase. After the PRD sections above are complete (Executive Summary, User Personas, User Journeys), invoke `/business-feature-map` to produce `.context/business/business-feature-map.md`.

The command covers the full feature taxonomy: feature catalog by domain (with stable `FEAT-NNN` IDs), CRUD matrix per entity, API endpoint inventory, UI component inventory (forms + dashboards), third-party integrations, feature flags, planned/WIP features, and the QA relevance matrix. Do not duplicate that logic inside this reference.

**Why split?** The feature map is now also useful outside the discovery pipeline (e.g. when only the backlog changes), so it lives as a standalone command that can be re-run on demand without going through the four-phase discovery again. It also keeps phase-2-prd.md focused on the human-readable PRD docs (summary, personas, journeys), with feature taxonomy as a sibling artifact rather than a section.

When the PRD is assembled, link from `executive-summary.md` and `user-journeys.md` to `business-feature-map.md` for the canonical feature list — never paste a feature catalog into those docs.

---

## Phase 2 — PRD exit gate

Before moving to the SRS half of Phase 2:

- [ ] `.context/PRD/executive-summary.md` exists, 5-or-fewer core capabilities, every row has evidence.
- [ ] `.context/PRD/user-personas.md` exists, 2-4 personas, Permission Matrix filled in, test-account mapping to `.env` complete.
- [ ] `.context/PRD/user-journeys.md` exists, Route Map has all three tables filled in, 3-5 journeys each with Evidence column populated, error paths included.
- [ ] `.context/business/business-feature-map.md` exists (produced by the `/business-feature-map` command, NOT by this phase). CRUD matrix complete for every core entity in the glossary, FEAT-NNN IDs assigned.
- [ ] All three PRD docs (executive-summary, user-personas, user-journeys) include a Discovery Gaps section. The feature map has its own gaps section.
- [ ] `## Phase 2 Progress - PRD` block present in `CLAUDE.md`, checkmarks on the three in-phase docs + a pointer to `business-feature-map.md`.

Proceed to `phase-2-srs.md` once the gate is met.

---

## Phase 2 — PRD gotchas

- **PRDs are discovery, not creation.** Do not re-scope the product. Describe what it does today; aspirational content goes in Discovery Gaps.
- **Personas = roles.** In existing systems, personas are the roles the authorization code recognizes. Do not invent "Sarah the busy marketer" -- document "admin", "editor", "viewer" with their actual permissions.
- **Journeys need step-level evidence.** Every step row needs a file path. If you cannot cite a file for a step, the step does not exist in the code; it is either a guess or a future feature -- flag accordingly.
- **Feature IDs and the catalog live in `business-feature-map.md`.** Stable `FEAT-NNN` IDs, CRUD matrix, third-party integration call-site rule, feature-flag defaults — all of that is owned by `/business-feature-map`. PRD docs (summary, personas, journeys) link to it instead of re-listing features.
- **Happy paths without error paths are incomplete.** Refuse to ship a journey doc that lists only the success flow. Error handling is half the behavior.
- **Breadcrumb patterns reveal hierarchy.** If a project uses breadcrumbs, their patterns are the canonical nesting model -- prefer them over navigation group names.
