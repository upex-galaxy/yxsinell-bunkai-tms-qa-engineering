description: "Onboard a project to this testing boilerplate and generate the context files that every QA and automation session depends on. Runs a 4-phase discovery (Constitution, Architecture, Infrastructure, Specification) that produces PRD, SRS, domain glossary, business-data-map, and test-ready fixtures.

Also use when .context/business/business-data-map.md is missing or stale. Do NOT use for writing tests (test-automation), documenting TCs (test-documentation), running suites (regression-testing), testing a ticket (sprint-testing), adapting the KATA architecture to the target stack (that is `/adapt-framework`), or syncing API endpoints (use `bun run api:sync` for technical sync; the `/business-api-map` command for the business angle)."

# Project Discovery — Onboarding Orchestrator

Turn an unknown codebase into a testable project. Four phases, always in order, gated on completion of the previous one. The output is a set of context files the rest of the skills (`shift-left-testing`, `sprint-testing`, `test-automation`, `test-documentation`, `regression-testing`) rely on.

The discovery is **conversational**: you read the code, ask when ambiguous, confirm before writing files. Never fabricate -- if you cannot verify a claim from the source, mark it as a "Discovery Gap" and move on.

Grounding methodology: **IQL (Integrated Quality Lifecycle)** — QA is continuous from requirement to release, not a gate at the end. The full rationale and step breakdown live in `docs/methodology/IQL-methodology.md` (shared across all QA skills). This skill does not depend on reading it — only point the user there if they ask why the discovery is structured this way.

---

## Inputs

Canonical reading order when starting cold on a discovery run. Read in order; stop earlier when the scope is small enough that later inputs add no signal.

1. **Target project repo** — path resolved at session start (see "Before starting: target repo location" below). Read code and any in-repo PRD. This is the primary source of truth — discovery is reverse-engineering, never aspirational design.
2. **Target repo's `README.md` and existing onboarding docs** — fastest path to project intent, stack signals, and run commands before deep code reads.
3. **`.context/` directory** (if partial state exists from a prior discovery run) — informs Phase 0 resume decisions and prevents redundant work. Diff against current code before overwriting.
4. **`.agents/project.yaml` and `.env.example`** — variable resolution patterns (`{{PROJECT_KEY}}`, env URLs, MCP names) that every downstream context file references.
5. **`kata-manifest.json`** — registry of existing KATA Components + ATCs. Anchors what test surface the boilerplate already expects so discovery records gaps coherently.
6. **`.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/skill-composition-strategy.md`** — workflow context for downstream skill hand-offs (`/adapt-framework`, `/sprint-testing`, `/test-documentation`).
7. **Business / domain docs supplied by the user** (Confluence, Notion exports, internal wikis) — secondary source for business model and glossary when in-repo signal is thin.

---

## Subagent Dispatch Strategy

> **Orchestration & Session contracts**: this skill follows `./orchestration-doctrine.md` (mandatory subagent dispatch — main thread is command center) AND `./session-management.md` (Phase 0 resume check, plan-first persistence at `.session/<skill-slug>/<scope>/`, archive on completion). Phase 0 (resume check) and Phase 1 (plan write) are NOT optional.

This skill is **project-scope**: no `<scope>` segment. Session state lives directly at `.session/project-discovery/{plan.md, progress.md}` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §3 + §9. This is the longest skill in the QA repo (1.5–4 hours, 4 hard-gate phases) and benefits most from per-phase checkpoints: if interrupted between Phase 2 (PRD/SRS) and Phase 3 (Infrastructure), resume reads `progress.md` and skips back to the first incomplete phase without re-prompting the user for already-confirmed scope.

This skill is compliant with the doctrine in `CLAUDE.md` §"Orchestration Mode (Subagent Strategy)" and the session contract in `.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md`. Per-phase dispatch decisions live in `Pick the scope first` below: Fresh = heavy subagent delegation per phase; Boilerplate adoption = medium; Brownfield + Context refresh = main session only.

---

## Phase 0 — Session resume check (MANDATORY, inline)

Before scope selection or any target-repo discovery, run the resume contract from `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §4:

1. Check `.session/project-discovery/progress.md`.
2. If it does NOT exist → proceed to "Before starting: target repo location" below, then "Pick the scope first" (which writes `plan.md`).
3. If it DOES exist:
   - Read `plan.md` (chosen scope, target repo path, phase plan).
   - Read tail of `progress.md` (last completed phase + next planned phase).
   - Surface to the user: scope chosen, target repo, last completed phase, next phase, any open Discovery Gaps from the last entry.
   - Offer **resume / restart / abort**. On `restart`, archive to `.session/.archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-project-discovery-aborted/` before proceeding.

Resume is high-value here: Fresh onboarding (1.5–4h) crossing a session boundary without resume re-runs Phase 1 from scratch, re-prompting target paths the user already confirmed.

---

## Before starting: target repo location

`/project-discovery` runs **read-only** against a project under test — the **target repo** — that is NOT this boilerplate. Before Phase 1 starts, lock down where the target lives. Block Phase 1 if the target path is ambiguous.

| Layout | What to declare | How to detect |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Monorepo** (single repo contains FE + BE) | Absolute or relative path from this repo | Check the candidate path for `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, `nx.json`, `lerna.json`, or a top-level `package.json` with no deps of its own |
| **Split sibling repos** (FE and BE cloned separately) | One path per repo (or a common parent dir) | Look at `../`-level siblings with plausible names (`*-backend`, `*-frontend`, `*-api`, `*-web`); confirm with the user |
| **Remote (not cloned yet)** | Repo URL + branch, then ask the user to clone locally before Phase 1 | `gh repo view` only returns metadata; real discovery needs local file access — do not try to discover from a URL |

Record the resolved path(s) in `.context/project-config.md` §Repositories during Phase 1 sub-step 1 (Project Connection). Every `<target-repo>` reference in later phases resolves to the path declared here.

If the layout is "split sibling repos", run Phase 1 sub-steps once per repo and merge findings into a single `project-config.md`; do not interleave.

---

## Pick the scope first

All projects go through the same 4 phases, but depth varies. Pick once, then follow the common pipeline.

| Scenario | Input | Phases to run | Typical depth | Context weight & subagent hint |
|----------|-------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **Fresh onboarding** (greenfield or unseen project) | Repo URL or local path(s), no existing context files | 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> Context generators | Full. All docs generated. After discovery complete, run `/adapt-framework` to modify the boilerplate. | **Heavy.** Delegate each phase's code survey to a dedicated subagent (Phase 1 project-connection + assessment, Phase 2 PRD/SRS drafting, Phase 3 infra mapping). Main session orchestrates, reviews outputs, and gates user confirmation between phases. |
| **Boilerplate adoption** (this repo adopted for a new project) | Target app repo(s), this repo as the test framework | 1 (project-connection) -> 3 -> Context generators | Skipping Phase 2 or Phase 4 is allowed **only** if every required input for `/adapt-framework` is already on disk: `.context/SRS/architecture.md`, `.context/business/business-data-map.md`, one of (`api/openapi-types.ts` non-stub / reachable OpenAPI spec URL / `.context/business/business-api-map.md`), plus `.context/infrastructure/{backend,frontend}.md`. If any is missing, fall back to the corresponding phase before invoking `/adapt-framework`. Do not skip phases on a hand-wave like "the docs exist elsewhere" — verify each file is on disk first. | **Medium.** Delegate Phase 1 project-connection + Phase 3 infra mapping to a subagent if the target is a monorepo (one subagent per package). Main session stays lean for `/adapt-framework` handoff. |
| **Brownfield** (project already documented, tests missing) | Existing `.context/` partially filled | 2 (gaps) -> 3 (gaps) -> Context generators | Targeted. Only regenerate what's missing/stale. | **Light.** Run in main session unless gaps span many files — then delegate the gap-filling pass per phase to a subagent. |
| **Context refresh** (data-map only) | User says "regenerate business-data-map" / "refresh the entity map" | Context generators only (just `business-data-map.md`) | One-file refresh. Confirm diffs before overwriting. **For PBI template refresh** (tracker moved, new custom fields), re-run Phase 4 in full instead — this scope handles data-map updates only, not templates. For the test plan, redirect to `/master-test-plan`. For API endpoints, redirect to `bun run api:sync` (technical) or `/business-api-map` (business angle). | **Minimal.** Main session only. No delegation needed. |

Default to "Fresh onboarding" when in doubt. Confirm the scope with the user before starting Phase 1.

After scope confirmation, **write `.session/project-discovery/plan.md`** per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §6 schema — Goal (the scope picked + target repo + expected outputs), Inputs (target repo path(s), existing `.context/` files), Approach (per-phase dispatch pattern per the table above), Phase breakdown (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → Context generators with skip rules per scope), Risks & open questions, Verification checklist (the pre-adapt-framework bullets below), Cross-references (cites `.context/business/`, `.context/PRD/`, `.context/SRS/`, `.context/infrastructure/`, `.context/PBI/`). Append `## Phase 0 — Session Init — <ts>` with `status: completed`, `next: Phase 1 — Constitution` to `progress.md`.

                                    `/business-api-map` (business angle).
```

> KATA adaptation is a separate command: `/adapt-framework`. It runs after discovery outputs exist and modifies this boilerplate's `tests/`, `api/schemas/`, and `config/` against the target stack.

Each phase has a **completion gate**: before moving on, the required output files must exist on disk with non-placeholder content. Ask the user to confirm after each phase; never auto-chain.

### Phase 1 — Constitution (who, what, why)

**Goal**: make the project legible. Outputs are read by every future session.

Four sub-steps, in order:

1. **Project Connection** -- repo paths, tech stack detection, environment URLs, credentials from `.env`, team contacts.
2. **Project Assessment** -- current testing maturity (frameworks in place, CI presence, lint/typecheck, coverage). Produces a risk profile.
3. **Business Model Discovery** -- problem statement, target users, value proposition, revenue model (if any). Business Model Canvas recommended.
4. **Domain Glossary** -- core entities, relationships, state machines, enumerations, UI-label vs code-identifier mapping.

**Completion gate**: `.context/business/business-model.md`, `.context/business/domain-glossary.md`, `.context/project-config.md` all exist and are non-empty. Plus a `## Project Assessment (Phase 1)` block in `CLAUDE.md` (CLAUDE.md is a symlink to it). Sanity-check content — these are soft gates, surfaced to the human as warnings, not hard aborts:
- `domain-glossary.md` contains at least 5 core-entity subsections (grep `^### ` yields 5+ matches, ignoring top-level H3s from "Enumerations" etc. — aim for real entities).
- `business-model.md` cites at least one concrete source (`Source:` or `Found in:` literal appears 3+ times).
- `project-config.md` has a `## Tech Stack` section AND a `## Environments` section.

After the automated sanity check, show the human the output paths and wait for explicit "Phase 1 complete, continue" before moving on.

Read `references/phase-1-constitution.md` when running any Phase 1 sub-step. Contains the discovery process, stack-detection commands, required output sections, and quality checklists.

### Phase 2 — Architecture (PRD + SRS)

**Goal**: produce the Product and Software Requirements docs from code (not the other way round -- that is the "creation" direction, this is the "discovery" direction).

PRD sub-steps (run first, in parallel or sequentially — user choice):
1. **Executive Summary** -- problem, solution, success metrics, scope.
2. **User Personas** -- roles, permissions, primary/secondary users, role hierarchy.
3. **User Journeys** -- critical paths through the UI, route map, journey diagrams.

> **Feature catalog is post-discovery.** The full feature inventory (`.context/business/business-feature-map.md`) is produced by the `/business-feature-map` command after all four discovery phases complete. Do not attempt to invoke it from here — it is token-heavy and the user is advised to run it in a clean session (see "Next recommended steps" at the end of this skill).

SRS sub-steps (run after PRD, serially):
1. **Architecture Specs** -- C4 context and container diagrams, component structure, database schema, external services, security model.
2. **Functional Specs** -- FR-N entries with preconditions, business rules, validations, state machines.
3. **Non-Functional Specs** -- performance budgets, security posture, reliability (RTO/RPO), scalability, observability, compliance.

> **API contracts are NOT an SRS output.** The technical surface is owned by `bun run api:sync` (generates `api/openapi-types.ts` from the project's OpenAPI spec). The business angle is owned by the `/business-api-map` command (`.context/business/business-api-map.md`). Phase 2 SRS only records where the spec lives (or flags its absence as a Discovery Gap). See `references/phase-2-srs.md` §2.

> **Test-architecture ADR seeding (Phase 2 SRS + Phase 3).** When the Architecture Specs / Infrastructure sub-steps settle a hard-to-reverse **test**-architecture decision — test runner/framework, isolation & parallelization model, fixture/test-data strategy, auth-in-tests, selector/`data-testid` contract, exploratory-vs-scripted boundary, CI sharding — promote each one that passes the two-gate test (architectural AND hard to reverse) to a standalone `ADR-NNNN-<slug>.md` in `.context/ADR/`, and reference it from `architecture.md` / `infrastructure/`. Greenfield: you are ENCODING the decision; brownfield: you are RECORDING the one you discovered. Follow `agentic-qa-core/references/adr-doctrine.md` (detection + authoring) and `.context/ADR/README.md` (template + lifecycle). AI drafts `Proposed`; the human accepts.

**Completion gate**: `.context/PRD/executive-summary.md`, `user-personas.md`, `user-journeys.md`, `.context/SRS/architecture.md`, `functional-specs.md`, `non-functional-specs.md` all exist. API contract source (OpenAPI URL, `api/openapi-types.ts`, or "Discovery Gap — no spec") is recorded in `.context/project-config.md`. `business-feature-map.md` is produced post-discovery by `/business-feature-map` (see "Next recommended steps" after Phase 4). Soft content checks:
- `architecture.md` contains at least one ` ```mermaid` block AND one of (`## Data Flow`, `## Database Schema`, `## Component Structure`).
- `functional-specs.md` contains at least one `FR-` identifier and one `BR-` identifier.
- `user-personas.md` lists at least 2 role entries (`### ` or table rows with role names).

Show outputs to the human and wait for "Phase 2 complete, continue" before moving on.

Read `references/phase-2-prd.md` when working on any PRD doc. Read `references/phase-2-srs.md` when working on any SRS doc. They are independent -- do not load both unless you are straddling both sides.

### Phase 3 — Infrastructure

**Goal**: make the project runnable and deployable for the test environment.

Three sub-steps:
1. **Backend Discovery** -- language, framework, database, ORM, auth, dependency manager, run/test commands, migrations, env vars.
2. **Frontend Discovery** -- framework, bundler, routing, state management, design system, component library, test IDs strategy.
3. **Infrastructure Mapping** -- CI/CD providers, deployment targets, environments (dev/staging/prod), infra-as-code, monitoring, rollback procedure.

**Completion gate**: `.context/infrastructure/backend.md`, `frontend.md`, `infrastructure.md` all exist with the key facts (auth flow, test commands, deploy URLs) filled in. Soft content checks:
- `backend.md` AND `frontend.md` each contain a `## Runtime` (or `## Build Configuration`) section AND a commands block (`bash` fenced) covering install + run.
- `infrastructure.md` lists environments explicitly (`| Staging |` or `| Production |` table row).
- At least one auth-flow pointer exists in `backend.md` (e.g., mentions `/auth/login`, `session`, `JWT`, `cookie`, `OAuth`).

Show outputs to the human and wait for "Phase 3 complete, continue" before moving on.

Read `references/phase-3-infrastructure.md` when running any Phase 3 sub-step. Contains framework-detection heuristics, required sections per artifact, and common gotchas (SSR vs CSR, edge vs serverless, monorepo vs split repos).

### Phase 4 — Specification (Backlog mapping)

**Goal**: hook the testing framework into the team's issue tracker without duplicating content.

Two sub-steps:
1. **PBI Backlog Mapping** -- connect to `{{ISSUE_TRACKER}}` via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]`, discover project key, map hierarchy (Epic/Story/Task/Bug), record queries used to fetch tickets.
2. **PBI Format-Reference Guides** -- produce the format-reference docs (`.context/PBI/templates/user-story.md`, `bug-report.md`, `test-plan.md`) that document the canonical shape of each artifact. These are reference-only — Jira is the source of truth, and per-ticket PBI content is **synced from Jira**, not authored locally from these.

> **Per-ticket PBI is NOT generated by this skill.** It is materialized later by `/sprint-testing` via `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments`, which writes the canonical synced tree `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/` (Module = Epic, 1:1). Those local `.md` files are a READ-ONLY cache of Jira (Jira = source of truth). This skill does NOT create per-ticket `story.md` — it only sets up the backlog access recipe (`README.md`) and the format-reference guides.

**Completion gate**: `.context/PBI/README.md` exists with project key + auth recipe; `.context/PBI/templates/*.md` exist. Soft content checks:
- `PBI/README.md` contains the configured `{{PROJECT_KEY}}` literal AND a `## Common Queries` section (or JQL / WIQL snippet).
- `.context/PBI/templates/user-story.md`, `bug-report.md`, `test-plan.md` each exist and are non-empty (format-reference guides).

Show outputs to the human and wait for "Phase 4 complete" before running the context generators / emitting the Next Recommended Steps block.

Read `references/phase-4-specification.md` when running Phase 4. Contains issue-tracker connection recipes, query conventions, and the full template set.

### Context Generators — the final deliverables

Two files, always generated last (they pull from every prior phase):

| File | Generator reference | What it contains |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| `.context/business/business-data-map.md` | `context-generators.md` §Generator | System flows, entities, triggers, cron jobs, webhooks, integration points. The canonical "what this system does" map. |

`.context/master-test-plan.md` is **not** produced by this skill — the `/master-test-plan` command owns it (reads `business-data-map.md` + optional `business-feature-map.md`). Run it after `business-data-map.md` exists.

Read `references/context-generators.md` when (re)generating `business-data-map.md`. This is where most "regenerate business-data-map" user requests land.

**API context is NOT a project-discovery output.** Endpoint sync is delegated to `bun run api:sync` (technical, OpenAPI -> TypeScript types) and the `/business-api-map` command (business angle: auth flows, critical paths, architecture behind the API). See `references/context-generators.md` §API context — deferred for the deferral note.

**See also:** After discovery outputs exist, run `/adapt-framework` to adapt this boilerplate's `tests/`, `api/schemas/`, and `config/` to the target stack.

---

## Per-phase progress + Archive

After each phase passes its completion gate AND the user confirms "Phase N complete", the orchestrator appends a phase entry to `.session/project-discovery/progress.md` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §7. One entry per phase: Phase 1 Constitution, Phase 2 Architecture (PRD then SRS), Phase 3 Infrastructure, Phase 4 Specification, then one per Context Generator. Each entry records `artifacts_touched` (the `.context/` files created or updated), `dispatched_as` (Single for Fresh-scope phases, inline for Brownfield / Refresh), `next` (next phase or `stop`).

After Context Generators land AND the Pre-adapt-framework checklist passes, the orchestrator runs Archive per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §8: moves `.session/project-discovery/` to `.session/.archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-project-discovery/` (two-file dir preserved) and calls `mem_session_summary` including the archive path so future search resolves back. The canonical `.context/` deliverables stay in place — those are the discovery output, not the session state.

On Phase-gate REJECT (user marks a phase incomplete or finds a Discovery Gap that blocks), archive does NOT run. The working directory stays so resume picks up at the failing gate.

---

## Next recommended steps (emit after Phase 4 completes)

Discovery populates PRD, SRS, glossary, and `business-data-map.md`. It does NOT invoke the business-context commands — they are standalone, token-heavy, and best run in a clean session so the AI has full budget.

When Phase 4 is confirmed complete, print this block to the user verbatim:

```
Discovery complete. `/project-discovery` has populated:
- .context/business/business-model.md, domain-glossary.md
- .context/project-config.md
- .context/PRD/executive-summary.md, user-personas.md, user-journeys.md
- .context/SRS/architecture.md, functional-specs.md, non-functional-specs.md
- .context/infrastructure/backend.md, frontend.md, infrastructure.md
- .context/PBI/README.md + templates/*.md
- .context/business/business-data-map.md

**Recommended next commands** (run each in order — ideally in a clean session; they are token-heavy):

1. `/business-feature-map` — catalog features, CRUD matrix, flags. Output: .context/business/business-feature-map.md
2. `/business-api-map`     — auth model, critical endpoints, architecture behind the API. Output: .context/business/business-api-map.md
3. `/master-test-plan`     — what to test and why, ranked by risk. Output: .context/master-test-plan.md

These are STANDALONE and can be re-run any time you want to refresh them.
`/project-discovery` itself is typically run once per project (or occasionally to refresh business model / glossary).

After running the three commands above, you are ready for `/adapt-framework`, which wires this boilerplate's KATA architecture against the target stack.
```

If the user asks to chain them automatically: decline politely. Each command consumes significant tokens and produces better output in its own session.

### Pre-adapt-framework checklist

<!-- keep in sync with .claude/commands/adapt-framework.md §Hard prerequisites -->

Before the user invokes `/adapt-framework`, verify every file below is on disk. If any is missing, re-run the phase that produces it (or the corresponding post-discovery command) before invoking `/adapt-framework`:

- [ ] `.context/PRD/` populated (at least `README.md`) AND `.context/business/business-model.md` or `domain-glossary.md` present
- [ ] `.context/SRS/architecture.md`
- [ ] `.context/infrastructure/backend.md` and `.context/infrastructure/frontend.md`
- [ ] `.context/business/business-data-map.md`
- [ ] API contract source: one of `api/openapi-types.ts` (non-stub) OR reachable OpenAPI spec URL OR `.context/business/business-api-map.md` (business-angle fallback)
- [ ] `.env.example` (and `.env` either present or created from it during `/adapt-framework` Phase 2)

Handoff line to print to the user:

> Discovery handoff complete. Ready for `/adapt-framework` iff the 6 bullets above are on disk. Missing any? Re-run the phase listed in the "Phases to run" column of the scopes table that produces it — or review the "Boilerplate adoption" row for phases you can skip when inputs already exist elsewhere.

## Stack-specific discovery rules

Base stack detection (package.json → Node, pyproject.toml → Python, go.mod → Go, `next.config.*` → Next.js, etc.) is a baseline skill any AI has. This section only lists **actions the skill should take based on what is detected** — rules that are not obvious from general programming knowledge.

| Signal | Action for discovery |
|--------|----------------------|
| Monorepo (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, `nx.json`, `lerna.json`, or top-level `package.json` with no deps of its own) | Split backend/frontend per package. Run Phase 1 **once** (project-level), Phase 2-3 **per package**. Merge outputs under `.context/infrastructure/` with sub-sections per package. |
| Multiple coexisting signals in one repo (e.g., Next.js + Express) | Almost always a monorepo — treat frontend and backend as separate discoveries even if workspace config is missing. Do NOT produce a merged SRS. |
| `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` present | Read compose for service inventory **before** scanning source — it is the authoritative runtime topology. Use source only to fill gaps. |
| No test framework deps detected | Greenfield test story. Phase 3 documents the absence as a Discovery Gap. **Do NOT install tooling in the target repo.** `/adapt-framework` wires this boilerplate's own test stack; it never modifies the target. |
| `.github/workflows/*.yml` present | Extract the test job from CI for Phase 3 Infrastructure — usually the cleanest source for "how CI runs tests". |
| API handlers found but no OpenAPI spec | Flag as Discovery Gap in Phase 2 SRS. Do NOT hand-write an OpenAPI inside project-discovery — either ask the user to expose one (so `bun run api:sync` works), or defer the business angle to `/business-api-map`. |
| Hardcoded secrets detected (grep hits in source) | HIGH risk. Record path in `.context/risk-assessment.md` §Phase 1 Project Assessment. Do NOT paste the secret into any discovery doc — reference path only. |

---

## Gotchas

- **Discovery is read-only on the target repo.** `.context/` is the only write target. For modifications to this boilerplate's `tests/`, `api/schemas/`, and `config/`, use `/adapt-framework`.
- **Hard-to-reverse test decisions become ADRs, not buried prose.** When Phase 2/3 settles a test-runner, isolation, fixture/data, auth-in-tests, or selector-contract decision that is architectural AND hard to reverse, record it as `.context/ADR/ADR-NNNN-<slug>.md` (append-only) instead of leaving it only inside `architecture.md`. Draft `Proposed`; the human approves. See `agentic-qa-core/references/adr-doctrine.md`.
- **Credentials never live in discovery docs.** Read them from `.env` (`LOCAL_USER_EMAIL`, `STAGING_USER_EMAIL`, etc.). If missing, ask the user to create `.env.example` or hand over secrets out-of-band -- do not paste them into markdown.
- **"Discovery Gaps" section is mandatory in every output.** If you could not verify something from the code (e.g., traffic volume, uptime targets), list it in a `## Discovery Gaps` section rather than inventing a number. This signals to future sessions what still needs human input.
- **PRD/SRS discovered from code is authoritative, not aspirational.** Describe what the system does, not what product wants it to do. If the user wants a "to-be" doc, that is PRD/SRS *creation* (out of scope for this skill); point them to their own product workflow.
- **Do not duplicate the backlog.** Jira/Linear/GitHub Issues is the source of truth for tickets. `.context/PBI/` holds the backlog access recipe (`README.md`) and format-reference guides (`templates/`), never a copy of the full backlog. Per-ticket PBI is synced on demand from Jira by `/sprint-testing` (`bun run jira:sync-issues`) as a read-only cache — this skill does not create it.
- **Monorepos require scoped discovery.** Run Phase 1 once (project as a whole) but Phases 2-3 per package. Merge findings into a single `.context/infrastructure/` with sub-sections per package.
- **Database schemas over ORM models.** If both exist, prefer the migration files / schema dump over the ORM definitions -- ORM definitions can drift from the live schema.
- **API base URL vs route prefix.** `{{environments.local.api_url}}` includes the protocol+host; route prefixes (e.g., `/api/v1`) belong in the path. Do not concatenate them twice in any context file that documents endpoints (e.g., `business-api-map.md`).
- **Auth flow is the single most important input for downstream `/adapt-framework`.** Session tokens, cookies, JWT, OAuth redirects, CSRF -- every project does it differently. Capture the real login request (DevTools / curl) in `backend.md` so the adaptation phase has a concrete contract to code against.
- **Never generate from stale context.** If `.context/business/business-data-map.md` already exists but the user asks to "refresh" it, diff the current code against the existing file and ask whether to overwrite or merge. Auto-overwrite loses prior human edits.
- **Context generators need ALL prior phases.** If the user jumps to "regenerate business-data-map" on a fresh repo, do Phase 1 (at minimum project-connection) and Phase 3 (backend discovery) first -- the generator relies on them.
- **IQL framing is optional.** Mention it only if the user asks "why this structure?" -- do not lecture them on methodology when they just want a working `business-data-map.md`.
- **API requests get redirected.** "Regenerate api-architecture" / "I need an API map" / "document the endpoints" -> stop and explain the split: `bun run api:sync` for technical types, `/business-api-map` for the business angle. This skill does not generate API documentation directly anymore.

## Templates (inline -- small, load-bearing)

### Discovery Gaps section (every output)

```markdown
## Discovery Gaps

The following items could not be verified from code and require human confirmation:

- [ ] <Gap>: <what is missing, where you looked, suggested source of truth>
- [ ] ...
```

### Phase completion ping (used after each phase)

```
Phase N complete.
Generated files:
- <path1>
- <path2>
Next: Phase N+1 (<phase name>). Confirm to continue, or say "pause" to stop here.
```

### `.env` key list emitted after Phase 1

```
# Application URLs (per-environment — match the env names you declared
# under `environments:` in `.agents/project.yaml`; consumed by
# `bun run agents:setup --non-interactive` via the `<KEY>_<ENV>` pattern)
WEB_URL_LOCAL=
WEB_URL_STAGING=
API_URL_LOCAL=
API_URL_STAGING=

# Test User Credentials
LOCAL_USER_EMAIL=
LOCAL_USER_PASSWORD=
STAGING_USER_EMAIL=
STAGING_USER_PASSWORD=

# Atlassian / TMS credentials (single source of truth, used by MCP, acli,
# xray-cli, sync scripts, and the Jira-Direct TMS provider — no overrides)
ATLASSIAN_URL=
ATLASSIAN_EMAIL=
ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN=
```

Larger templates (full PRD sections, KATA component skeletons, `.context/infrastructure/backend.md` layout, `business-data-map.md` structure) live in the references.

## Specific tasks -- which reference to read

- **Phase 1 (project connection, assessment, business model, glossary)** -> read `references/phase-1-constitution.md`.
- **Phase 2 PRD (executive summary, personas, journeys, features)** -> read `references/phase-2-prd.md`.
- **Phase 2 SRS (architecture, API contracts, functional, non-functional)** -> read `references/phase-2-srs.md`.
- **Phase 3 (backend, frontend, infrastructure)** -> read `references/phase-3-infrastructure.md`.
- **Recording a hard-to-reverse test-architecture decision (ADR)** -> read `agentic-qa-core/references/adr-doctrine.md` + `.context/ADR/README.md`.
- **Phase 4 (backlog mapping, templates)** -> read `references/phase-4-specification.md`.
- **Generating `business-data-map.md`** -> read `references/context-generators.md`. For the test plan, run `/master-test-plan` (command, not skill).
- **API endpoint sync (technical) or business-API map** -> NOT this skill. Use `bun run api:sync` (technical types) or `/business-api-map` command (business angle).
- **User asks about IQL methodology** -> point them to `docs/methodology/IQL-methodology.md` (shared across QA skills). This skill no longer carries its own IQL reference.
- **Code exploration (grep, read files)** -> use built-in tools. If the user wants a browser-driven exploration instead (UI-first discovery), load `/playwright-cli` skill.
- **Issue-tracker operations (Phase 4)** -> resolve `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` via CLAUDE.md Tool Resolution. For Jira, load `/acli` skill (primary) or fall back to the Atlassian MCP. If the project also uses Xray for TMS, load `/xray-cli` additionally.
- **Database inspection** -> resolve `[DB_TOOL]`; read-only queries only during discovery.
- **Session contract (Phase 0 resume, plan.md/progress.md schemas, archive policy, Engram per-phase checkpoint)** -> read `../agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md`. This skill is a producer of `session/project-discovery/...` topic keys.

## Anti-patterns — NEVER do these

- **P1.** NEVER invent business entities, flows, or requirements not present in the target repo code or PRD. Discovery is reverse-engineering, not aspirational design — unverified items go in a `## Discovery Gaps` block, never inline.
- **P2.** NEVER skip Phase 1 (Constitution) when starting fresh. Downstream phases (PRD/SRS, infrastructure, PBI mapping) assume the project values and stack are fixed first; skipping leaves later artifacts ungrounded.
- **P3.** NEVER fill `.context/business/business-data-map.md` from memory or from a prior session's draft. Re-read target code and PRD per session, regenerate via the `/business-data-map` command so the map stays anchored to current source.
- **P4.** NEVER mix `/project-discovery` with `/adapt-framework` in the same session. Discovery reads the target repo only; adapt edits THIS boilerplate. The blast radii are different and interleaving them confuses the read-only contract.
- **P5.** NEVER use `/project-discovery` for incremental updates. Use the `/business-*-map` regenerative commands instead — discovery is one-shot per project (or rare full refresh), not a per-feature loop.
- **P6.** NEVER skip the domain glossary in Phase 1. Downstream skills read it as a precondition when present: `sprint-testing` lists it in its Stage 1 planning inputs (ATP, refined ACs, TC outlines) and `test-documentation` uses it as the vocabulary reference for TC naming and bodies.
- **P7.** NEVER fabricate Jira / Xray field IDs or status names in `.context/master-test-plan.md` or any PBI template. Run `bun run jira:sync-fields --force` and reference `{{jira.<slug>}}` via the slug catalog in `.agents/jira-required.yaml`.

## Quick reference

```bash
# Phase 1 — Project Connection (detection commands)
ls -la <target-repo>                      # repo root
cat <target-repo>/package.json | jq .     # JS/TS stack
cat <target-repo>/pyproject.toml          # Python stack
ls <target-repo>/.github/workflows        # CI presence
find <target-repo> -maxdepth 2 -name "docker-compose*.yml" -o -name "Dockerfile"

# Phase 2 — PRD/SRS source-of-truth order
# 1. Read routes (frontend app/ or pages/ or router.ts)
# 2. Read API handlers (src/controllers/ or src/routes/ or src/api/)
# 3. Read DB schema (prisma/schema.prisma, migrations/, schema.sql)
# 4. Read auth config (middleware.ts, auth.config.ts, passport config)

# Phase 3 — Infrastructure
cat <target-repo>/.env.example             # env var contract
grep -r "process.env\." <target-repo>/src  # env vars actually read
cat <target-repo>/.github/workflows/*.yml  # CI/CD pipeline

# Context generators (final step)
# Output path:
#   .context/business/business-data-map.md
# Test strategy and API context are produced separately (NOT by this skill):
#   /master-test-plan               # test strategy (reads data-map + feature-map)
#   bun run api:sync                # API technical types from OpenAPI
#   /business-api-map               # API business angle: auth flows, critical paths

# Issue tracker (Phase 4) — example placeholder
# Prerequisite: Load /acli skill before executing the commands below.
[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Get Issue:
  key: {{PROJECT_KEY}}-1
[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Search Issues:
  project: {{PROJECT_KEY}}
  query: sprint in openSprints() AND assignee = currentUser()
