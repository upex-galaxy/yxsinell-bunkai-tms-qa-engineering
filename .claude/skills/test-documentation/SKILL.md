Use when creating Test/ATP/ATR artifacts, calculating ROI to choose which tests to automate, maintaining US-ATP-ATR-TC traceability, or repairing broken TMS links. Supports four scopes: module-driven (exhaustive module exploration), ticket-driven (QA-approved user story), bug-driven (regression TC for a closed bug), and ad-hoc/exploratory.

## Forbidden invocations

**NEVER invoke `/sdd-*` skills from this workflow.** SDD is an optional
user-installed ceremony; this skill ships self-contained and does not chain
SDD under any condition. If you need to refactor KATA, fixtures, cli/,
scripts/, or api/schemas/ pipeline, exit this skill first and invoke
`/framework-development` — which itself runs Plan → Code → Verify → Archive
natively (no SDD required).

This boundary is mechanical, not advisory: `scripts/lint-skills.ts` rejects
any `/sdd-` mention outside this section. See:
`.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/skill-composition-strategy.md` §4
(governs users who manually install SDD).

# Test Documentation — QA Bridge

Take already-validated tests and formalize them in the TMS (Jira, Xray, or equivalent) with full traceability, the right priority, and a clear automation verdict.

Three phases, always in this order: **Analyze -> Prioritize (ROI) -> Document**. Never skip prioritization: most scenarios should end up Deferred, not automated.

One hard prerequisite: the tests being documented must describe behavior that was **already validated** ({{jira.status.story.qa_approved}} story, closed bug, or finished exploratory session). The TMS is a documentation and regression-protection tool, not an exploration tool.

---

## Dependencies

Requires `agentic-qa-core`. Loads on demand:

- `agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md` — **MANDATORY before deriving TCs from acceptance criteria.** Governs the 1:N TC explosion, the formal-technique triggers, and the floor-not-ceiling coverage model. EP + BVA are operationalized here against the canon.
- `agentic-qa-core/references/defect-management-doctrine.md` — **MANDATORY before parenting a Test or raising an Improvement.** Governs QA process-epic parenting (every `Test` hangs from the **QA Test Repository** epic, Part 4), the mandatory `components` axis (Part 3), and the Improvement bridge for under-specified ACs (Part 1). This skill files no Bugs.
- `agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md`, `./dispatch-patterns.md`, `./orchestration-doctrine.md`, `./session-management.md`, `./preflight-gate.md`, `./traceability-linking.md` — cited inline by the sections that use them.

## Compact Rules

**Test-design doctrine (binding — full canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md`):**

- Documenting an AC→TC map is the FLOOR (≥1 TC per AC is a minimum, never a target). Coverage = AC-conformance + risk-beyond-AC; the TC set must include boundary / negative / state / anomaly cases the AC is silent on.
- 1:N applies to DERIVATION (consider many cases by technique), not to the REGRESSION repository. Only regression-worthy scenarios (Candidate/Manual) are persisted there; most are Deferred. jira-native: Stage 4 CREATES `Test`s for those only (Deferred = report-only). jira-xray: sprint `Test`s already exist (Stage 1) — Stage 4 PROMOTES the regression-worthy into the Test Plan + enriches them. Document because it will be re-run, never to hit a count.
- Apply techniques by trigger: EP always; BVA wherever a range/limit/length/date-window exists; State-Transition for stateful entities; Decision Table when 2+ conditions interact; Pairwise when 3+ combinable factors.
- Parametrize for artifact economy: same-behavior data variants → ONE Test (`Scenario Outline` + `Examples` rows) per partition, NOT N separate Tests; split only when action / outcome / status / state differs. (Canon: doctrine §"Part 2.5".)
- Cross-cutting characteristics (XSS, perf, a11y) deferred to app-level suites are an EXPLICIT handoff, not a silent drop — name the receiving suite or file the gap.

**Test-documentation operational rules:**

- Documents already-validated behavior only — not an exploration tool (exploration belongs to `/sprint-testing`).
- TC identity = Precondition + Action + verifiable outcome. Naming (TC): `{US_ID}: TC#: should <expected outcome> [<connector> <condition>] [given <precondition>]`; `Validate <feature>` is reserved for the GROUPING layer (Test Set summary / `describe()`). Reject `"Login test"`, `"Login - error"`, `"TC1: Test form"`.
- ROI formula → one of three verdicts per TC: Candidate (feeds test-automation), Manual, Deferred. Prioritize by risk.
- Cardinality: US→TC is 1:N; AC→TC is N:1 or N:M. Resolve TMS modality (Xray vs Jira-native) in Phase 0 before documenting.
- Bug-driven (GOLDEN RULE): not every bug is a regression TC, but a regression-worthy bug MUST end with a Test — REUSE the existing failed Test if it came from one, else CREATE one (both modalities). A non-qualifying bug is treated like a failed test → Deferred, no new Test.

## Subagent Dispatch Strategy

> **Orchestration & Session contracts**: this skill follows `./orchestration-doctrine.md` (mandatory subagent dispatch — main thread is command center) AND `./session-management.md` (Phase 0 resume check, plan-first persistence at `.session/<skill-slug>/<scope>/`, archive on completion). Phase 0 (resume check) and Phase 1 (plan write) are NOT optional. The orchestrator also applies the per-stage **Definition-of-Done gates** in `./stage-gates.md`: verify a stage's DoD (planning stages include the Test-Design Checklist) BEFORE recording its progress checkpoint and advancing.

This skill is **per-scope**: `<scope>` = `<JIRA-KEY>` (ticket / bug scope), `<module-slug>` (module scope), or `<YYYY-MM-DD>-adhoc` (ad-hoc scope). Session state lives at `.session/test-documentation/<scope>/{plan.md, progress.md}` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §3 + §9.

**Naming collision note**: this skill already owns `## Phase 0 — Resolve TMS modality` (the TMS gate). The session resume check is therefore named `## Phase -1 — Session resume check` to avoid colliding with the existing Phase 0 anchor. Resume fires FIRST, then the TMS modality gate, then the rest of the pipeline.

This skill is compliant with the doctrine in `CLAUDE.md` §"Orchestration Mode (Subagent Strategy)" and the session contract in `.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md`. Every dispatch follows the 6-component briefing format defined in `.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md`, and the pattern selected per phase matches the decision guide in `.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/dispatch-patterns.md`. Phase 1 (Analyze) and Phase 2 (Prioritize) stay inline because planning and decisions live in the orchestrator; the only Parallel hotspot is bulk TC creation in Phase 3, which is also the only step that branches per TMS modality.

| Phase                                                  | Pattern    | Subagent role                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Phase -1 — Session resume check                        | inline     | orchestrator only; reads `.session/test-documentation/<scope>/progress.md` if present, offers resume / restart / abort per `./session-management.md` §4    |
| Phase 0 — Resolve TMS modality                         | inline     | orchestrator only; existing 4-step probe — unchanged                                                                                                        |
| Phase 1 — Analyze scope                                | Single     | inline — planning lives in the orchestrator (anti-pattern to delegate)                                                                                      |
| Phase 2 — ROI / Candidate-Manual-Deferred verdict      | Single     | inline — decisions live in the orchestrator                                                                                                                 |
| Phase 3 — TMS TC creation (N > 10 TCs)                 | Parallel   | M subagents, chunks of ~5-10 TCs per agent; cap = 10 to avoid Jira/Xray rate limits; each subagent loads `/xray-cli` (Modality jira-xray) or `/acli` (Modality jira-native)  |
| Phase 3 — TMS TC creation (N ≤ 10 TCs)                 | Single     | inline — dispatch overhead is not justified for small batches                                                                                               |
| Phase 3 — Traceability linking (US <-> ATP <-> ATR <-> TCs) | Single     | inline — requires aggregated state of all created entities                                                                                                  |
| Phase 3 — Final report / coverage matrix               | Single     | inline — synthesis lives in the orchestrator                                                                                                                |

- **Concurrency cap = 10 subagents** for Parallel TC creation. Jira and Xray APIs both rate-limit at ~10 writes/sec sustained; fanning out wider triggers 429 responses. If a module has >100 TCs, batches per subagent must be larger than 10 each (cap is on subagent count, not chunk size).
- **Error protocol**: On any subagent failure: STOP, report the partial success state (which TCs landed, which failed, with their issue keys / errors), present retry / skip / abort options. Do NOT auto-fix nor auto-rollback. See `.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/orchestration-doctrine.md`.

---

## Readiness Preflight Gate (MANDATORY — runs before Phase -1)

> Full doctrine: `agentic-qa-core/references/preflight-gate.md`. Runs FIRST, before the resume check and before the TMS-modality gate. Two laws: (1) **args-as-answers** — the scope (module / ticket / bug / ad-hoc) and any stated modality are provided args; ask only the gaps. (2) **probe, don't assume**. Surface gaps + REDs as ONE `AskUserQuestion` checklist; self-fix with approval + explanation; STOP on any blocking RED. This skill documents already-validated behavior in the TMS — it does NOT execute against a live system, so its gate centers on TMS write capability. **Generic baseline** (env resolution, test-user creds, secret/restart handling, the two laws, output contract) is inherited from the reference §3.1 — not repeated here. Below is only this skill's **specific capability delta**.

| Capability | Need | Why here |
|---|---|---|
| Issue-tracker (`[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]`) | REQUIRED | TC / ATP / ATR creation, linking, transitions. Load `/acli`; validate via `bun run jira:check`. |
| TMS modality + `[TMS_TOOL]` | REQUIRED | The whole Phase 0 gate. jira-xray → `/xray-cli` loaded + `XRAY_*` creds set + Xray issue types present. jira-native → `/acli` covers it. Resolve before Phase 1; ask only if all auto-checks fail. |
| Source repos readable | OPTIONAL | Phase 1 source-code validation reads backend/frontend code, not a running env — no live-env or DB/API/browser probe needed. |

Active env, test-user creds, DBHub, OpenAPI/`API_TOKEN`, Playwright, `resend` and `kata-manifest.json` (an automation-only concern owned by `/test-automation`) are **N/A** — documentation never hits a live system nor writes test code. After the gate clears (all REQUIRED GREEN), continue to Phase -1 below.

---

## Phase -1 — Session resume check (MANDATORY, inline)

Runs BEFORE Phase 0 (TMS modality gate). Compute prospective `<scope>` from invocation: `<JIRA-KEY>` for ticket/bug scope, `<module-slug>` for module scope, `<YYYY-MM-DD>-adhoc` for ad-hoc. Then:

1. Check `.session/test-documentation/<scope>/progress.md`.
2. If it does NOT exist → proceed to Phase 0 (TMS modality).
3. If it DOES exist:
   - Read `plan.md` (chosen scope, TMS modality, TC list, ROI verdicts).
   - Read tail of `progress.md` (last completed phase + next planned phase).
   - Surface to the user: scope, TMS modality, last completed phase, next phase, any pending TC creation chunks that did not finish (the most common interruption point — Phase 3 parallel bulk create capped at 10 subagents).
   - Offer **resume / restart / abort**. On `restart`, archive to `.session/.archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-test-documentation-<scope>-aborted/` first.

Critical resume case: Phase 3 parallel bulk create interrupted mid-batch. The `progress.md` records per-chunk completion (one entry per Parallel subagent return), so resume skips already-created TCs by reading the chunks marked `completed` and dispatching only the missing chunks. This is why per-subagent checkpoint matters (see Phase 3 below).

---

## Phase 0 — Resolve TMS modality (mandatory gate)

Every project runs in one of two modalities. Resolve it **before** Phase 1. The same ATP/ATR/TC concepts have **different containers** in each mode.

### The question you MUST answer first

```
Does this project have Xray installed and licensed on Jira?
  A. Yes -> Modality jira-xray
  B. No  -> Modality jira-native (no Xray)
```

### How to resolve it without asking (in order)

1. Check `CLAUDE.md` for `{{TMS_CLI}}`. Value `bun xray` (or any Xray CLI) -> **Modality jira-xray**. Value is unset, `acli`-only, or `{{TMS_CLI}}` matches `{{ISSUE_TRACKER_CLI}}` -> **Modality jira-native**.
2. If `CLAUDE.md` is ambiguous, look for a `.context/master-test-plan.md` line such as `TMS: Xray on Jira` or `TMS: Jira native`.
3. If still ambiguous, list existing issue types in the project via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] List issue types`. If the project exposes `Test Plan` / `Test Execution` / `Test Set` / `Pre-Condition`, it is **Modality jira-xray**. Otherwise **Modality jira-native**.
4. **Only if all three checks fail**, ask the user the question above. Do NOT ask by default — autoresolve first.

### What changes per modality

| Artifact | Modality jira-xray | Modality jira-native |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **ATP** (Acceptance Test Plan) | `Test Plan` issue titled `ATP: {STORY-KEY}: {story title}`, parented to the **QA Master Test Plan** epic, linked to the US | Same `Test Plan` issue **by excellence** (native Jira work type, Xray-independent); falls back to the Story `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` field (then a `## Acceptance Test Plan (ATP)` comment) **only when the Test Plan work type is absent** from the instance. |
| **ATR** (Acceptance Test Results) | `Test Execution` issue with Test Runs per TC, Environment, Begin/End Date, titled `ATR: {STORY-KEY}: Story Testing`, parented to the **QA Test Artifacts** epic | Same `Test Execution` issue **by excellence**; falls back to the Story `{{jira.acceptance_test_results}}` field (then a `## Acceptance Test Results (ATR)` comment) **only when the Test Execution work type is absent** from the instance. |
| **TC** (Test Case) | Xray `Test` issue (type Manual / Cucumber / Generic) | Jira-native `Test` issue type (or `Task` with custom type), Description carries the full TC template |
| **Test Set / Precondition / Test Plan** | First-class Xray issue types | Not available — use labels + Epic grouping |
| **Result sync** | CI imports JUnit/Cucumber via `[TMS_TOOL] Import Results` -> Test Runs auto-update | Custom script updates Test Status field on each TC + comment with build context |
| **CLI tag** | `[TMS_TOOL]` resolves to `bun xray` or equivalent | `[TMS_TOOL]` falls through to `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` (acli / Jira MCP) |

### Persist the decision

Once resolved, save the modality into `.session/test-documentation/<scope>/plan.md` §Inputs (canonical session record) and ALSO mirror to `test-session-memory.md` for the ticket (if one exists, for per-ticket sub-agent context). Treat as sticky: do not re-resolve mid-session. If you detect drift (e.g. `[TMS_TOOL]` suddenly fails), stop and ask the user before re-resolving.

Reference implementations:
- Modality jira-xray concepts + Xray REST/GraphQL/CLI -> `references/xray-platform.md`
- Modality jira-native project setup (Test issue type, Screen Scheme, custom fields) -> `references/jira-setup.md`
- Both modes side-by-side (field mapping, workflow, Description template) -> `references/jira-test-management.md`

---

## When to use each scope

Pick the scope based on the input, not the output. All four scopes share the same Analyze -> Prioritize -> Document pipeline; only the input source and defaults differ.

| Scope | Input | Typical volume | Default labels | Notes |
|-------|-------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| **Module-driven** | A module of the system explored end-to-end | 20-100+ scenarios | `regression`, `e2e` or `integration` | Batch of TCs grouped under the Regression Epic. Most scenarios will be Deferred. |
| **Ticket-driven** | A QA Approved user story from a sprint | 3-8 scenarios | `regression`, plus the test type | Output of a `sprint-testing` session. ATP/ATR created per US. |
| **Bug-driven** | A closed bug with a verified fix | 0-2 scenarios | `regression`, `automation-candidate` (usually) | Run the Bug-driven decision (below). Not every bug qualifies; if it does, **reuse the existing failed Test or create one** — an important bug must end with a Test. ROI biased up: "it failed once, it can fail again." |
| **Ad-hoc / Exploratory** | New scenarios found in exploratory testing | 1-10 scenarios | `regression` | Apply the 3 Phase-0 questions harshly; ad-hoc scenarios are often one-time validations. |

If the user gives you a story ID, use ticket-driven. If they give you a bug ID, use bug-driven. If they give you a module name or a session output, use module- or ad-hoc accordingly.

### Bug-driven decision — "an important bug must have a test" (GOLDEN RULE)

Not every bug becomes a regression Test — a one-time typo in a stable area is **treated like a failed test** (the fix was verified in sprint-testing) and Deferred. But run the **same analysis + prioritization** you'd run on any scenario; if the bug IS regression-worthy, it **MUST end with a Test that covers it**, in BOTH modalities. *Where there is an important bug, there must be a test that catches it again — this rule is worth gold.*

```
1. Is this Bug/Defect a regression candidate?  (apply Phase-0 filter + ROI; the prior-bug rule biases up)
   NO  -> No new Test. Treat as a failed test: fix already verified in sprint-testing -> log as Deferred. Done.
   YES -> step 2.

2. Was the bug found FROM an existing, already-executed Test?  (a Test that ran and failed — jira-native OR xray)
   YES -> REUSE that existing Test for the bug's retest + regression. It already lives in the test set;
          ensure it is linked to the bug (`tests / is tested by`) and promoted into regression. Do NOT duplicate.
   NO  -> CREATE + design the corresponding Test for the bug's retest.
          jira-native: new `Test` issue.  jira-xray: new Xray `Test` (+ plugin-appropriate Test Plan / Test Set linking).
          Link to the bug via `tests / is tested by`.
```

This **overrides** sprint-testing's "the bug is the test case" — that phrase covers only the immediate in-sprint retest, NOT future regression. The retest reproduces+verifies the fix now; this rule decides whether a *persistent* Test must exist (reuse or create) so the bug can never silently return.

**Scope handoff to `/test-automation`.** The `Candidate` TCs produced here flow downstream to `/test-automation`, which **re-scopes** them into its own 3 planning scopes: `module-driven → Module (Macro)`, `ticket-driven → Ticket (Medium)`, `bug-driven → Regression-driven (Micro)`. `ad-hoc / exploratory` Candidates have no 1:1 automation scope — they enter under whichever fits (a module batch, or regression-driven for a single TC). `Manual` and `Deferred` verdicts are terminal and never reach automation.

After scope confirmation, **write `.session/test-documentation/<scope>/plan.md`** per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §6 — Goal (scope + TMS modality + expected TC count), Inputs (PBI references, ATP source, prior bugs), Approach (per-phase dispatch table above), Phase breakdown (Phase 1 Analyze → Phase 2 Prioritize → Phase 3 TC creation with chunk count → Traceability → Final report), Risks, Verification checklist (all TCs created with traceability + coverage matrix written), Cross-references (`.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/test-cases/*.md` per-TC files + `.context/reports/` coverage matrix). Append `## Phase -1 — Session resume check — <ts>` with `status: completed`, `next: Phase 0 — Resolve TMS modality` to `progress.md`.

---

## Phase 1 — Analyze

### Inputs you must gather

| Source | What to read | Why |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| User Story / Epic | Description, ACs, comments, linked issues | Scenario identification, risk signals |
| Closed bugs linked to the story | Summary, root cause, fix area | Prior-bug prioritization rule |
| Exploratory session notes | Validated scenarios, observations | Reuse nomenclature already used |
| Existing ATP (if present) — **modality-aware** (see §Phase 0) | **jira-native**: Story field `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` → synced `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/acceptance-test-plan.md` (read-only Jira cache — sync via `bun run jira:sync-issues get <STORY> --include-comments`). **jira-xray**: Test Plan issue `description` → `bun run jira:sync-issues get <ATP_KEY>` → `test-plans/TESTPLAN-<KEY>-<slug>.md`; per-TC run state via `[TMS_TOOL]` (xray-cli) | Scenarios may already exist — do not reinvent |
| Existing ATR (if present) — **modality-aware** (see §Phase 0) | **jira-native**: Story field `{{jira.acceptance_test_results}}` → synced `acceptance-test-results.md` (same `jira:sync-issues get <STORY> --include-comments`). **jira-xray**: Test Execution issue `description` → `bun run jira:sync-issues get <ATR_KEY>` → `test-executions/TESTEXEC-<KEY>-<slug>.md` (sync supports these types); per-TC run results via `[TMS_TOOL]` (xray-cli) | Prior run results — do not re-execute what is already recorded |
| Implementation plan / source code | Actual files, APIs, test IDs | Validate design matches implementation before documenting |
| `.context/business/domain-glossary.md` (if present) | Canonical entity + process names, anti-glossary banned terms | Vocabulary reference for TC names, steps, and preconditions — terms must match the glossary |

### Separate real scenarios from cross-cutting characteristics

Cross-cutting traits are **validated inside every test**, not as separate TCs.

| Cross-cutting (NOT a TC) | Validated by |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| Mobile responsive | Running each test in mobile viewport |
| XSS prevention | Using special-character test data inside tests |
| Performance | Timing assertions inside tests |
| Accessibility | A11y assertions inside UI tests |
| API contract | Response schema checks inside API tests |
| Generic "error handling" | Specific negative-path scenarios |

> **Deferral ≠ omission.** Moving a cross-cutting trait out of per-feature TC scope is an **explicit handoff**, not a silent drop. Each row must land somewhere: woven into a TC's data/assertions (the table above) OR owned by a named app-level suite (XSS / perf / a11y regression suite). If no such suite exists for a trait the feature genuinely exposes, file the gap (Deferred TC or a note in the ATR) — never let it evaporate.

A real scenario is a **user flow**: clear business objective, concrete precondition + action, verifiable outcome. The TC name uses the `should` form — `{US_ID}: TC#: should <expected outcome> [<connector> <condition>] [given <precondition>]`; reserve `Validate <feature>` for the GROUPING layer (Test Set summary / `describe()`), never for the individual case.

### Source-code validation (mandatory before documenting)

The design in the ATP was written before code existed. Before creating any TC:

1. Open the implementation plan (if any) and list the files it touches.
2. Grep the actual code for `data-testid=`, route handlers, API paths, and text formats.
3. Compare the ATP's assumptions against what the code does. If they diverge, correct the TC design and add a Refinement Notes section.

Common discrepancies to check for:
- An API the ATP assumed exists turns out to be SSR/direct DB.
- UI text format in the ATP ("based on N reviews") vs reality ("(N reviews)").
- Hardcoded IDs in the ATP vs variable pattern required in TMS.

Skipping this step is the single most common cause of invalid automated tests later.

### TC identity rule (load-bearing)

**A TC is defined by Precondition + Action**. All expected results from the same (precondition, action) pair belong to the **same TC**, not separate TCs.

```
Same TC:                                    Different TCs:
  Precondition: valid credentials             Precondition: valid credentials     -> TC-A
  Action:       submit login                  Precondition: locked account        -> TC-B
  Assertions:   redirect + token + welcome    Precondition: invalid credentials   -> TC-C
                (all one TC)                  (all same action, but preconditions differ)
```

Splitting one (precondition, action) into N "check panel A / check panel B / check panel C" TCs is a textbook anti-pattern. One TC, multiple assertions.

### Technique-driven TC derivation (1:N — full canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md`)

One AC yields **multiple** TCs by default. Derive them by the AC's shape, then let the TC-identity rule above merge only *within* a partition — never across partitions, boundaries, or states. Reduce an AC to a single TC only with a written `trivially atomic` justification.

| Trigger in the AC | Technique | TCs produced |
|---|---|---|
| Any input (always) | **Equivalence Partitioning** | same-output inputs → one parameterized TC (Scenario Outline + Examples); different-output inputs → separate TCs |
| A range / limit / length / date-window | **Boundary Value Analysis** | TCs at `min-1·min·min+1 … max-1·max·max+1` + zero / empty / null / overflow (EP alone misses off-by-one) |
| A status / lifecycle field | **State-Transition** | one TC per valid transition + per invalid transition |
| 2+ interacting conditions | **Decision Table** | enumerate combos, collapse equivalents, one TC per surviving rule |
| 3+ combinable factors | **Pairwise** | all-pairs TC set (log the reduction) |

These are **candidate scenarios** derived by technique — not yet TMS work items. ROI (Phase 2) then decides which become **persistent regression TCs** (Candidate → automated, Manual → manual) and which stay **Deferred** (recorded in the prioritization report, **NOT created in the TMS**). Deriving widely is free; persisting is ROI-gated — most scenarios are Deferred. You document a scenario because it will be re-run, never to hit a count.

> **Improvement bridge (`agentic-qa-core/references/defect-management-doctrine.md` Part 1).** When a test-beyond-AC exposes a gap **because the AC was under-specified or absent** — the system violated no defined criterion — the right artifact is an **Improvement** issue (filed per the doctrine, or delegated to `/sprint-testing`), NOT a regression TC and NOT a silent widening of the Story's ACs. Track the proposal as an Improvement; do not edit the Story's AC set after the fact.

---

## Phase 2 — Prioritize (ROI)

Every scenario passes three gates in order. Fail any gate -> Deferred.

### Phase 0: The three filter questions

1. **Does it protect against FUTURE regressions?** If the bug was a one-time typo in a stable area, the answer is no. Defer.
2. **Are there PRIOR bugs in this area?** Yes -> prioritize even with moderate ROI ("it failed once, it can fail again").
3. **Is it an APP-level concern or a FEATURE-level concern?** XSS / a11y / performance / responsive are APP-level suites, not per-feature TCs. Defer from this scope.

### ROI formula (load-bearing)

```
ROI = (Frequency x Impact x Stability) / (Effort x Dependencies)
```

Each factor is scored 1-5 independently:

| Factor | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frequency (how often run) | Yearly / rarely | Every release | Every sprint | Daily | Every PR / commit |
| Impact (if it fails) | Cosmetic | Minor inconvenience | Degrades UX | Blocks feature | Revenue / core business |
| Stability (of the flow) | Very volatile | Unstable | Moderate | Stable, minor changes | Unchanged for months |
| Effort (to automate) | Trivial | Low (hours) | Moderate (1-2 days) | High (several days) | Very high (week+) |
| Dependencies | None | 1-2 simple | 3-4 | 5+ | Complex externals |

Note: Effort and Dependencies are **divisors** — higher score = worse. The other three are multipliers.

### Component value bonus

If a TC is reusable across multiple E2E flows:

```
Component Value = Base ROI x (1 + 0.2 x N)
```

where `N` = number of E2E flows that consume it. A low-ROI atomic like `authenticateSuccessfully` can become automate-worthy purely through reuse.

### Three outcomes (load-bearing)

Every scenario ends in exactly one of these buckets. There is no fourth.

| Outcome | Triggers it | Where it goes next | TMS status flow |
|---------|------------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Candidate** | ROI > 3.0, OR (ROI 1.5-3.0 AND prior bug), OR critical happy path | Feeds `test-automation` skill | Draft -> In Design -> Ready -> In Review -> Candidate |
| **Manual** | ROI 0.5-1.5 AND not automatable (human judgment, visual inspection), OR explicitly manual-only | Terminal: manual regression suite | Draft -> In Design -> Ready -> Manual |
| **Deferred** | ROI < 0.5, OR failed Phase-0 filter, OR one-time validation | Terminal: not in regression. Can be revisited if system changes | **jira-native**: do not create a TC in the TMS — document as Deferred in the prioritization report. **jira-xray**: the sprint `Test` (created in `/sprint-testing` Stage 1) is **not promoted** to the Regression Test Plan — it stays as a sprint execution artifact, not deleted. |

**Rule of thumb**: if more than 50% of candidates end up Candidate or Manual, re-apply Phase 0 more strictly. Most scenarios should be Deferred.

> **Modality changes the verb in Phase 3, not the verdict here.** The ROI verdicts (Candidate / Manual / Deferred) are identical in both modalities. What differs is the action: **jira-native** — Phase 3 *creates* `Test` work items for Candidate + Manual only (Deferred is report-only). **jira-xray** — the `Test` work items already exist from `/sprint-testing` Stage 1 (Xray's `Test` is the execution unit); Phase 3 *selects + promotes* the Candidate/Manual ones into the Regression Test Plan (label `regression-candidate`) and **enriches** them (rich Gherkin, parameterization, edge elaboration — the "specify much more" pass). Deferred sprint Tests are left as-is, unpromoted. See `sprint-testing/SKILL.md` §"TC creation timing (modality-aware)".

---

## Phase 3 — Document in TMS

### Preflight: Regression Epic

Every documented TC must have a parent Regression Epic (single test repository for the project).

> **This Regression Epic IS the QA Test Repository process epic** (`agentic-qa-core/references/defect-management-doctrine.md` Part 4). Resolve it **found-or-created** by the configured name `qa.qa_epics.test_repository_epic.name` (**"QA Test Repository"**); on absence create it once, write the test-repository strategy into its description, and cache its key into `.agents/project.yaml` `qa.qa_epics.test_repository_epic.key`. It is a **QA process epic — never a product/dev epic, never unparented.** Per the three-axis model this parent says only "which QA bucket tracks the Test"; the Test's **product area travels on `components`** (Part 3) and its **Story coverage travels on the issue link** (Part 4) — never on this parent.

> **Prerequisite**: Load `/acli` skill before executing commands below.

```
[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Search Issues:
  project: {{PROJECT_KEY}}
  query: type = Epic AND summary ~ "QA Test Repository"      # resolve by configured name qa.qa_epics.test_repository_epic.name
```

If none exists, ask the user before creating one with name `QA Test Repository` (the value of `qa.qa_epics.test_repository_epic.name`) and labels `test-repository, regression`.

### Preflight: Test Set — feature organizer (1:1 with the Epic)

A **Test Set** groups all regression Tests of ONE feature — **1:1 with the Epic/module**. It is the feature-level organizer under the Regression Epic. Three containers, do not conflate: **Regression Epic** = repository umbrella · **Test Set** = feature grouping · **Test Plan** = execution/regression scope.

- **Modality jira-xray**: resolve the feature's Test Set (match by Epic key / feature name) via `[TMS_TOOL]`. If it does **not** exist, **ask the user before creating** one named `Test Set: <EPIC_KEY> <feature>` (mirror the Regression-Epic ask-before-create rule — creation is otherwise async/manual; the AI only creates it lazily here when a promotion needs it). **Only promoted, regression-worthy Tests (Candidate/Manual) are added to the Set** in this phase — Deferred sprint Tests are NOT added.
- **Modality jira-native**: there is **no Test Set entity**. Achieve the same feature grouping with the **Regression Epic + a feature/Epic label** (e.g. `epic-<EPIC_KEY>` or the feature slug). Apply the label to each documented TC.

### Entity model: ATP / ATR / TC

Four entities. **Traceability model (jira-xray):** the **Story links ONLY to its ATP and ATR** ("is tested by"); **TCs are NOT linked directly to the Story** (avoids noise) — they aggregate through the ATP/ATR. The **ATP "designs" the TCs** (TC "is designed by" ATP) and the **ATR "executes" the TCs** (TC "is executed by" ATR). Full doctrine: `references/traceability-linking.md` + `references/tms-architecture.md`.

| Entity | Created | Naming | Main content |
|--------|---------|--------|--------------|
| **US** (Story) | Pre-existing | `{{PROJECT_KEY}}-{n}` | The requirement |
| **ATP** | Stage 1 (or now, if missing) | `ATP: {STORY-KEY}: {story title}` | Test Analysis + AC-to-TC coverage |
| **ATR** | Stage 1 (or now, if missing) | `ATR: {STORY-KEY}: Story Testing` | Test Report + execution results |
| **TC** | Stage 4 (this phase) | `{US_ID}: TC#: should <expected outcome> [<connector> <condition>] [given <precondition>]` | Precondition + Action + Expected |
| **Test Set** (xray only) | Lazily in Stage 4 if missing (ask first); else pre-existing (async) | `Test Set: <EPIC_KEY> <feature>` | Feature-level grouping (1:1 Epic) of promoted regression Tests. Native: replaced by a feature/Epic label, no entity. |

Read `references/tms-architecture.md` when creating ATP/ATR/TC for a ticket, checking required links, or validating that a story is fully documented.

### Linking order (always)

```
1. Create ATP -> link to US (Story "is tested by" ATP)
2. Create ATR -> link to US (Story "is tested by" ATR)
3. Update ATP -> link to ATR (bidirectional plan/results)
4. For each TC:
     Create TC -> link to ATP (TC "is designed by" ATP) + ATR (TC "is executed by" ATR)
     # Do NOT link the TC directly to the Story — TCs aggregate via ATP/ATR (avoids Story-link noise).
     # AC coverage is recorded in the ATP's AC-to-TC matrix, not as a Story<->TC issuelink.
5. For each PROMOTED (regression-worthy) TC:
     jira-xray  -> [TMS_TOOL] add TC to the feature Test Set (resolve/create per Preflight) + [TMS_TOOL] add to the Regression Test Plan
                   + [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] label `regression-candidate` (labels are a Jira field; xray-cli has no update-label for existing Tests)
     jira-native -> [ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] apply the feature/Epic label (no Test Set entity)
```

> Per-op tool resolution + the Gherkin-enrichment CLI gap: `references/jira-test-management.md` §"Stage-4 promote + enrich — tool resolution map". Load `/xray-cli` for command syntax — never hardcode it here.

Creating a TC before the ATP and ATR exist leaves orphaned references. Fix any broken links with `references/tms-architecture.md` §Traceability Rules.

### Creating TCs — modality matrix

| TMS stack | Manual test | Automation-candidate test |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Xray on Jira** | **Two-step** (Xray Cloud silently drops inline steps): (1) `[TMS_TOOL] Create Test: type=Manual` **without** inline steps, (2) `[TMS_TOOL] Add Test Step` per step (optionally verify with `[TMS_TOOL] Get Test`), then `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Update Issue` to paste the complete Description template | `[TMS_TOOL] Create Test: type=Cucumber, gherkin=<high-quality gherkin>` then `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Update Issue` with the Description template |
| **Native Jira (no Xray)** | `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Create Issue: issueType=Test, description=<steps table>` | `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Create Issue: issueType=Test, description=<gherkin in Description>` |

Always populate Description with the full TC template (Related Story, Priority, ROI, Prior bugs, Test Design gherkin/steps, Variables table, Implementation Code table, Architecture, Available Test IDs, Preconditions, Expected Results). Read `references/jira-test-management.md` when choosing between Xray and native Jira, or when the Description must be filled.

> **Dispatch**: Use the dispatch defined in §Subagent Dispatch Strategy: **Parallel** when N > 10 TCs (cap = 10 subagents), inline otherwise. The full briefings for both Modality jira-xray (via `/xray-cli`) and Modality jira-native (via `/acli`) live in `references/tms-architecture.md` §"Parallel TC creation". The sharding rule, error protocol, and aggregation contract are documented there. The serial flow below is the canonical procedure each subagent runs internally for its assigned chunk.

### High-quality Gherkin (for Candidates)

```gherkin
@{priority} @regression @automation-candidate @{US_ID}
Scenario Outline: should <outcome> <connector> <condition>
  """
  Bugs covered: BUG-1, BUG-2
  Related Story: {US_ID}
  """

  # === PRECONDITIONS (tester / script builds them) ===
  Given <entity> exists with <identifier>
  And <entity> has <quantity> <elements> where <quantity> <condition>

  # === ACTION ===
  When the user navigates to "<route>"
  And the user <main_action>

  # === VALIDATIONS ===
  Then <ui_element> is displayed with format "<expected_format>"
  And <additional_validation>

  # === EQUIVALENT PARTITIONS ===
  Examples: Happy path
    | ... |
  Examples: Edge case
    | ... |
```

Rules that always apply:
- **Variables, never hardcoded data**: `{mentor_id}` not `550e8400-...`. Include a Variables table with how to obtain each.
- **Tags always include**: priority (`@critical|@high|@medium|@low`), suite (`@regression`, `@smoke` if critical path), automation flag (`@automation-candidate`), traceability (`@{US_ID}`).
- **Structured comments**: `# === PRECONDITIONS ===`, `# === ACTION ===`, `# === VALIDATIONS ===`, `# === EQUIVALENT PARTITIONS ===`.
- **Docstring with metadata**: related story, bugs covered, ROI.

### Workflow transitions

> **Substrate reference**: state and transition names below resolve from `.agents/jira-workflows.json` (manifest at `.agents/jira-required.yaml` `work_types.test_case`). Use `{{jira.status.test_case.<slug>}}` and `{{jira.transition.test_case.<slug>}}` in skill code; the substrate maps the slug to the literal Jira name. See `references/tms-conventions.md` §5 for the full state machine.

```
Draft --start_design--> In Design --ready_to_run--> Ready --+-- for_manual                  --> Manual    (terminal manual)
                                                            +-- automation_review_from_ready --> In Review
                                                                                                  |
                                                                                                  +-- approve_to_automate --> Candidate (feeds test-automation)
```

Never jump states. If a TC needs rework, use a `back_from_<state>` transition (e.g. `back_from_ready` -> in_design).

### Naming — the one rule that matters

```
{US_ID}: TC#: should <expected outcome> [<connector> <condition>] [given <precondition>]
```

- Prefix is **ALWAYS `{US_ID}`** (the User Story key) in every modality — Jira-native, Xray with Test Sets, Xray without. Test Set membership is expressed via an issue **link** ("is part of" / Test Set membership), NEVER in the TC title.
- `CORE` (expected outcome): verb + object phrased after `should` — the asserted behavior (`grant access`, `reject login`, `cap input length`).
- `CONDITIONAL`: the optional connector clause (`when …` / `if …`) plus an optional `given <precondition>`. Omit entirely for unconditional behavior.
- Vocabulary: entity and process names inside `<expected outcome>` / `<condition>` come from `.context/business/domain-glossary.md` when present — canonical terms only; anti-glossary banned terms must not appear in TC titles or bodies.
- In code (KATA): `@atc('PROJ-101')` decorator (the TC's Jira key, string literal only — no template literals) and `should <behavior> when <condition>` in `test()` blocks; the grouping `describe()` uses the `'{US_ID}: Validate <feature>'` form.

Anti-patterns to reject: `"Login test"`, `"Login - error"`, `"TC1: Test form"`.

### Labels — baseline per TC

Every TC gets at least one scope label and one status label:

- Scope (required, one+): `regression` (almost always), `smoke` (critical path only — aim for 10-20% of suite), `e2e`, `integration`, `functional`.
- Status (applied as it moves): `automation-candidate`, `manual-only`, `automated`. `automation-candidate` and `manual-only` are mutually exclusive; remove `automation-candidate` once it becomes `automated`.
- Priority (optional): `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`.

Full reference in `references/tms-conventions.md` §Labels.

### Local cache (Claude Code convention)

After TMS creation, write one markdown file per TC into `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/test-cases/{TC-ID}-{slug}.md`. Template in `references/jira-test-management.md` §Local cache. This per-TC cache is NON-Jira (hand-authored) — it is NOT a synced Jira mirror, so author it locally. The directory is `test-cases/` (NOT `tests/` — the sync script owns the top-level `.context/PBI/tests/` tree for Jira Test issues). This prevents re-reading the TMS in future sessions and gives `test-automation` an immediate handoff.

### Per-phase progress + Archive

After each Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Phase 3 step completes (including each Parallel TC-creation chunk in Phase 3), the orchestrator appends a phase entry to `.session/test-documentation/<scope>/progress.md` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §7. Per-chunk entries are critical: a 60-TC batch dispatched as 6 chunks of 10 produces 6 separate `## Phase 3.chunk-<N>` entries, each recording which TC IDs landed. Resume reads completed chunks and dispatches only the missing ones.

After Phase 3 Final report + coverage matrix land, the orchestrator runs Archive per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §8: moves `.session/test-documentation/<scope>/` to `.session/.archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-test-documentation-<scope>/` (two-file dir preserved) and calls `mem_session_summary` with the archive path. The canonical per-TC `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/test-cases/*.md` files + coverage matrix in `.context/reports/` stay in place as committed deliverables.

On Phase 3 partial failure (some chunks 429-rate-limited, some succeeded), archive does NOT run — `progress.md` retains the per-chunk state so resume picks up the missing ones.

## Gotchas

- **ROI divisors matter**: Effort and Dependencies go in the denominator. A "critical flow" with Effort=5 and Dependencies=5 has low ROI by design — that is correct, not a bug in the formula.
- **Prior-bug rule overrides ROI thresholds**: a scenario tied to a closed bug enters regression even at ROI 1.5-3.0. Source: `test-prioritization.md` + `atc-definition-strategy.md` — both agree.
- **Cross-cutting is not a TC**: "Mobile responsive", "XSS prevention", "Performance" are never TCs on their own. They are validated inside other TCs or in an app-level suite.
- **Linking order is not optional**: create ATP and ATR BEFORE the first TC. If you create TCs first, you get orphaned references and `fix-traceability` is the only way out.
- **Xray requires two calls**: one `[TMS_TOOL] Create Test` (registers in Xray), then one `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Update Issue` to paste the full Description. Skipping the second call leaves a TC with no readable documentation in Jira.
- **Xray Manual steps are added AFTER create, never inline**: Xray Cloud **silently drops** steps passed to the create call. For a `type=Manual` Test, create it WITHOUT inline steps, then add each step one-by-one via `[TMS_TOOL] Add Test Step`; optionally verify with `[TMS_TOOL] Get Test`. Cucumber Tests are unaffected (Gherkin is a single field). Concrete CLI syntax lives in `/xray-cli`.
- **Never hardcode UUIDs or emails** in Gherkin. Always use `{variable}` with a Variables table and a query showing how to obtain the real value at runtime.
- **One (precondition, action) = one TC**. Multiple expected results all belong to the same TC. Splitting assertions into separate TCs is the single most-diagnosed anti-pattern in reviews.
- **Bug-driven: evaluate first, but if regression-worthy it MUST have a Test (reuse or create).** A closed bug is strong empirical evidence the area regresses, so most qualify and lean Candidate — but not all do (a one-time typo in a stable area is treated like a failed test → Deferred, no new Test). When it qualifies, follow the Bug-driven decision: reuse the existing failed Test if the bug came from one, else create + design a new Test. Golden rule: where an important bug exists, a test must cover it.
- **Source-code validation is mandatory**: the ATP was written before code. Grep for `data-testid=`, routes, text formats. Log discrepancies in a Refinement Notes section on the TC.
- **Derive widely, document only the repeatable, automate the few — three layers, three counts.** (1) DESIGN/derive (in `/sprint-testing` planning + exploration): consider many cases by technique (1:N) — this lives in the prioritization analysis, NOT yet in the TMS. (2) DOCUMENT (this skill): create a persistent TMS TC **only** for scenarios worth re-running — Candidate (automated regression) + Manual (manual regression). Deferred scenarios are recorded in the prioritization report and **NOT created in the TMS** (see Three outcomes). (3) AUTOMATE (`/test-automation`): the Candidates. So "analyzed 80 → documented 12 → automated 8" is the healthy shape — **never "document all 80"**. (jira-xray nuance: the 80 may already exist as sprint `Test` artifacts from `/sprint-testing` Stage 1; there "document 12" means **promote 12** into the Regression Test Plan, leaving the rest as unpromoted sprint artifacts.) The guiding principle: *a test enters the regression repository because it will be re-executed (manual or automated), never to hit a coverage count.* If most scenarios end up Candidate/Manual, re-apply Phase 0 harder — most should be Deferred.
- **TC prefix is ALWAYS the User Story key (`{US_ID}`)** — no longer modality-dependent. In every modality (Jira-native, Xray with Test Sets, Xray without), the TC title is prefixed with the US key. Test Set membership is expressed via an issue link ("is part of" / Test Set membership), NEVER in the TC title.

---

## Specific tasks

- **Creating ATP/ATR/TC for a story or checking links** -> read `references/tms-architecture.md` (entity model, required fields, linking sequence, completeness criteria).
- **Naming a TC, filling fields, picking labels, or choosing Gherkin vs Traditional** -> read `references/tms-conventions.md` (naming formulas, label taxonomy, workflow state machine, ROI table).
- **Working in Jira native or Jira+Xray mode, creating tests via the right tool, or producing the full Description template** -> read `references/jira-test-management.md` (mode comparison, Xray issue types, Description template, local cache template, CI/CD sync).
- **Fixing broken traceability (TC not linked to US/ATP/ATR, name wrong)** -> use the procedure in the Linking Order section above, backed by `references/tms-architecture.md` §Traceability Rules.
- **Deciding if a bug deserves a regression TC** -> run the **Bug-driven decision** (§"When to use each scope"): Phase 0 Q2 (prior bug = prioritize) + ROI → if regression-worthy, **reuse the existing failed Test or create a new one** (golden rule); if not, treat as a failed test → Deferred, no new Test.
- **TMS operations** -> load `/xray-cli` skill for concrete CLI syntax. Issue-tracker operations resolve via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` per CLAUDE.md Tool Resolution.
  - **Reads vs writes split** (per `agentic-qa-core/references/acli-integration.md` §"Reads vs writes"): detailed READS (custom fields, ACs, ATP/ATR, description, comments, linked bugs) -> `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments` (or `jql "<query>"`), then read the synced `.md` — NEVER `acli workitem view` for custom fields. TMS WRITES (create Test / Test Plan / Test Execution / link / transition / comment / import) + traceability/List-Tests link-graph reads -> `[TMS_TOOL]` (acli/xray). Trivial metadata + list/search lookups (issue types, key lists) -> acli `view`/`search`.
- **Session contract (Phase -1 resume, plan.md/progress.md schemas, per-chunk checkpoint for Parallel TC creation, archive policy, Engram per-phase checkpoint)** -> read `../agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md`. This skill is a producer of `session/test-documentation/<scope>/...` topic keys.

## Inputs

Canonical reading order for any AI starting cold on a test-documentation workflow. Read in order; stop earlier when the scope is narrow enough that later inputs add no signal.

> **TMS modality** (A: Xray vs B: Jira-native) is resolved live by Phase 0 from `.agents/project.yaml` `testing.tms_cli` and sticky in `plan.md`. **Regression Epic** is resolved live by Phase 3 §Preflight via JQL (`type = Epic AND labels = "test-repository"`). **Label taxonomy** defaults are hardcoded in `references/tms-conventions.md`. No external TMS config file is read.

1. `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/` — ticket-local context (module = Epic, 1:1). The detailed read materializes the **FULL synced Story folder**; read **ALL of it** — every per-field `.md` (`story.md`, `acceptance-criteria.md`, scope, business rules, etc.) **plus `comments.md`** — not just one field, so ACs / scope / business rules / comment context are never omitted. Existing ATP and ATR are **modality-aware reads** (see §Phase 0): **jira-native** → Story-folder `acceptance-test-plan.md` / `acceptance-test-results.md` (synced from Story fields `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` / `{{jira.acceptance_test_results}}`); **jira-xray** → `test-plans/TESTPLAN-<KEY>-<slug>.md` (Test Plan `description`) / `test-executions/TESTEXEC-<KEY>-<slug>.md` (Test Execution `description`, sync supports these types), with per-TC run results via `[TMS_TOOL]` (xray-cli).
2. `.agents/jira-required.yaml` — canonical slug catalog for fields, statuses, link types.
3. `.agents/jira-fields.json` — slug → numeric custom-field-ID mapping for ADF / API calls.
4. `.agents/jira-workflows.json` — `test_case` workflow + transition catalog (Draft → In Design → Ready → …).
5. `.context/master-test-plan.md` — regression Epic, prioritization rubric, what to test and why.
6. The Story's AC + spec via `bun run jira:sync-issues get <STORY> --include-comments`, then read **every** synced `.md` in the materialized folder — current Description, AC, scope, business rules, `comments.md`, linked bugs — not just one field. NEVER use `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` `view` (returns null for custom fields). **TC note**: a TC body = the `Test` issue `description` (synced both modalities via `bun run jira:sync-issues get <TEST-KEY>`); the Xray Gherkin / Test-Steps plugin field is NOT synced — it mirrors the description, so read the synced TC `.md` for Gherkin/steps.

---

## Anti-patterns — NEVER do these

- **D1.** NEVER hand-write ADF JSON for Test Case / ATP / ATR bodies. Use the md-to-adf path via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]`; ADF authored by hand drifts and breaks renderers.
- **D2.** NEVER ship a Test Plan without traceability to a Story / Epic. Orphan ATPs are unauditable — link before the first TC lands.
- **D3.** NEVER over-detail Test Case steps. The spec / KATA ATC is the source of truth; the TC step list is a pointer, not a duplicate.
- **D4.** NEVER skip ROI scoring. Every TC ends with a Candidate / Manual / Deferred verdict before handoff to `/test-automation`.
- **D5.** NEVER mix Modality jira-xray and Modality jira-native inside the same Story's ATP. Modality is one-shot per project and Phase 0 resolves it.
- **D6.** NEVER fabricate Jira field IDs. Run `bun run jira:sync-fields --force` and resolve via `{{jira.<slug>}}` — hardcoded `customfield_NNNNN` drifts silently.
- **D7.** NEVER link an ATR to multiple ATPs. The relationship is 1:1 (one plan, one results record); multiple ATRs per ATP is fine, the inverse is not.
- **D8.** NEVER reopen a Closed bug to attach a regression TC. File a new TC and link to the bug via `tests / is tested by` — bug history stays immutable.

## Quick reference — pseudocode per modality

Resolve `[TMS_TOOL]` / `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` via `CLAUDE.md` §Tool Resolution. The shape of the calls differs by modality — the two blocks below are parallel, pick one based on Phase 0.

### Regression epic (both modalities, run once per project)

> **Prerequisite**: Load `/acli` skill before executing commands below.

```
[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Search Issues:
  project: {{PROJECT_KEY}}
  query: type = Epic AND summary ~ "QA Test Repository"   # resolve by configured name qa.qa_epics.test_repository_epic.name

# If none, ask the user before creating:
[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] Create Issue:
  project: {{PROJECT_KEY}}
  issueType: Epic
  title: "QA Test Repository"
  labels: test-repository, regression, qa
```

### Modality jira-xray

> **Prerequisite**: Load `/xray-cli` and `/acli` skills before executing commands below.

### Modality jira-native (no Xray) — DEGRADED FALLBACK ONLY

> **Items first (both modalities)**: by excellence ATP is a native Jira `Test Plan` issue
> (`ATP: {STORY-KEY}: {story title}`, parented to **QA Master Test Plan**) and ATR a `Test
> Execution` issue (`ATR: {STORY-KEY}: Story Testing`, parented to **QA Test Artifacts**) — use
> the `[TMS_TOOL] Create TestPlan` / `Create Execution` blocks above, since both are native Jira
> work types regardless of Xray. The Story-field path below is the **degraded fallback**, used
> ONLY when those work types are unavailable in the instance and cannot be created/linked. As
> soon as the items exist they are the single source of truth and the fields are not used.
> Mirrors `references/tms-architecture.md` §"Modality jira-native — DEGRADED FALLBACK ONLY".
