## Forbidden invocations

**NEVER invoke `/sdd-*` skills from this workflow.** SDD is an optional
user-installed ceremony; this skill ships self-contained and does not chain
SDD under any condition. If you need to refactor KATA, fixtures, cli/,
scripts/, or api/schemas/ pipeline, exit this skill first and invoke
`/framework-development` — which itself runs Plan → Code → Verify → Archive
natively (no SDD required).

This boundary is mechanical, not advisory: `scripts/lint-skills.ts` rejects
any `/sdd-` mention outside this section. See:
`.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/skill-composition-strategy.md` §4
(governs users who manually install SDD).

# Regression Testing — Execute, Analyze, Decide

Orchestrates the full release-readiness pipeline: trigger a CI suite, monitor it to completion, classify failures, score against release criteria, and emit a GO / CAUTION / NO-GO verdict plus a stakeholder report.

Three phases, always in this order: **Execute → Analyze → Report**. Do not skip analysis and jump to a report. Do not guess classification without reading failure logs.

---

## Inputs

- `.github/workflows/*.yml` — workflow files for regression / smoke / sanity suites; defines triggers, inputs, and artifact uploads.
- `.context/master-test-plan.md` — regression Epic key + expected pass-rate SLOs per suite.
- `playwright.config.ts` — reporter config, retry policy, project matrix; needed to interpret retry counts and shard splits.
- Previous run's Allure report (artifact URL or local download under `./analysis/previous/`) — baseline for trend computation.
- `kata-manifest.json` — registry of tests and ATCs available; used to cross-reference failed test IDs.
- `.agents/jira-required.yaml` — Jira refs (project key, work types, transitions) for filing regression issues.
- `agentic-qa-core/references/defect-management-doctrine.md` — **canonical authority** for classifying (Bug/Defect/Improvement), the mandatory field matrix, QA-Assignee ownership, and the QA process epic when a confirmed regression is filed in Jira (Phase 3). Read BEFORE filing any defect.

---

## Subagent Dispatch Strategy

> **Orchestration & Session contracts**: this skill follows `./orchestration-doctrine.md` (mandatory subagent dispatch — main thread is command center) AND `./session-management.md` (Phase 0 resume check, plan-first persistence at `.session/<skill-slug>/<scope>/`, archive on completion). Phase 0 (resume check) and Phase 1 (plan write) are NOT optional. The orchestrator also applies the per-stage **Definition-of-Done gates** in `./stage-gates.md`: verify a stage's DoD BEFORE recording its progress checkpoint and advancing.

This skill is **per-run scope**: `<scope>` = `<env>-<YYYY-MM-DD>` (e.g. `staging-2026-05-20`). Session state lives at `.session/regression-testing/<scope>/{plan.md, progress.md}` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §3 + §9. The single highest-value resume case: if the Monitor subagent dies while watching a long CI run but `RUN_ID` was captured in `plan.md`, Phase 0 re-attaches via `gh run view <RUN_ID>` instead of re-triggering CI (saves 20–60 min of wall-clock).

This skill is compliant with the doctrine in `CLAUDE.md` §"Orchestration Mode (Subagent Strategy)" and the session contract in `.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md`. Every dispatch follows the 6-component briefing format defined in `.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md`, and the pattern selected per stage matches the decision guide in `.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/dispatch-patterns.md`. The two CI-bound stages (long-running watch, multi-artifact download) and the high-volume failure classification step are the hotspots — everything else stays inline because the dispatch overhead is not justified.

| Stage                                                      | Pattern    | Subagent role                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trigger workflow (`gh workflow run`)                       | Single     | inline — no dispatch needed (one shell call)                                                                   |
| Wait/monitor `gh run watch`                                | Background | one Monitor subagent runs the watch; main thread continues with prep work; subagent notifies on exit           |
| Download 3 artifacts (allure / evidence / playwright)      | Parallel   | 3 simultaneous subagents, one per artifact; cap = 3 (no rate-limit risk)                                       |
| Classify failures (chunks of ~10 tests each)               | Parallel   | N subagents based on failure volume; cap = 10 to avoid context dilution                                        |
| Compute metrics (pass-rate, trends)                        | Single     | inline — needs aggregated state, low cost                                                                      |
| Generate executive report                                  | Single     | inline — final synthesis, decisions live here                                                                  |
| GO / CAUTION / NO-GO verdict                               | Single     | inline — main thread owns release decisions                                                                    |

- **Error protocol**: On any subagent failure: STOP, report full context to user, present retry / skip / abort options. Do NOT auto-fix. See `.claude/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/orchestration-doctrine.md`.

---

## Readiness Preflight Gate (MANDATORY — runs before Phase 0)

> Full doctrine: `agentic-qa-core/references/preflight-gate.md`. Runs FIRST, before the resume check and any `gh workflow run`. Two laws: (1) **args-as-answers** — the suite (regression/smoke/sanity), env, and any grep/test_file are provided args; ask only the gaps. (2) **probe, don't assume**. Surface gaps + REDs as ONE `AskUserQuestion` checklist; self-fix with approval + explanation; STOP on any blocking RED. This generalizes the Phase 1 §Preflight (`gh auth`) to a full readiness check pulled to t=0. **Generic baseline** (env resolution, secret/restart handling, the two laws, output contract) is inherited from the reference §3.1 — not repeated here. Below is only this skill's **specific capability delta** (note: test-user creds, MCPs and browsers live inside the CI runner, not the orchestrator).

| Capability | Need | Why here |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub CLI authenticated | REQUIRED | Every stage drives CI via `gh` (`gh auth status`, `gh workflow run`, `gh run watch`, `gh run download`). Not authed → user runs `gh auth login` (suggest the `!` prefix); do not proceed. |
| Workflow files present | REQUIRED | `.github/workflows/` must hold the regression/smoke/sanity workflow for the chosen suite, with the inputs this skill passes. |
| GitHub Actions Secrets/Variables | REQUIRED | The runner authenticates with env-prefixed creds (`secrets.<ENV>_USER_EMAIL` / `_PASSWORD`) + `XRAY_*` / `ATLASSIAN_*` as Repository/Environment Secrets — the suite 401s mid-run without them. `gh secret list` (add `--env <env>` for environment scope) shows them; missing → `gh secret set <NAME>` from `.env`. `/adapt-framework` only emits a manual list today, so this is the most common silent gap. |
| Allure 3 local | REQUIRED | `bunx allure` resolves (devDep, no global install); `allurerc.mjs` present for `bun allure:agent` markdown triage. |
| Active env | REQUIRED | The suite runs against `<<ACTIVE_ENV>>` (default `{{DEFAULT_ENV}}`). Confirm it is the intended target before a 20–60 min run. |
| `[TMS_TOOL]` (result sync) | OPTIONAL | Only when `.agents/project.yaml` `testing.tms_cli` is set — Stage 3 pushes run status. jira-xray → `/xray-cli` + `XRAY_*`. |
| `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` (file regression issues) | OPTIONAL | Only on NO-GO / CAUTION-with-regressions, to file issues. Load `/acli` then. |

Test-user creds, OpenAPI/`API_TOKEN`, DBHub and Playwright browsers live **inside the CI runner**, not the orchestrator — this skill does not exercise them locally, so they are out of scope for this gate. After the gate clears (all REQUIRED GREEN), continue to Phase 0 below.

---

## Phase 0 — Session resume check (MANDATORY, inline)

Before suite selection or any `gh workflow run`, run the resume contract from `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §4:

1. Compute prospective `<scope>` = `<env>-<YYYY-MM-DD>` from invocation context (env defaults to `{{DEFAULT_ENV}}`).
2. Check `.session/regression-testing/<scope>/progress.md`.
3. If it does NOT exist → proceed to suite selection + Phase 1 preflight + plan.md write.
4. If it DOES exist:
   - Read `plan.md` (captured `suite`, `env`, `workflow_file`, `RUN_ID` if Phase 1 already triggered).
   - Read tail of `progress.md`.
   - If `RUN_ID` is present AND `progress.md` last entry is `Phase 1 — Trigger — status: completed` but Monitor entry is missing/failed: surface the option to **re-attach** to the existing `RUN_ID` via `gh run view <RUN_ID> --json status,conclusion` instead of re-triggering. This is the high-value resume case.
   - Otherwise surface the standard offer **resume / restart / abort**. On `restart`, archive to `.session/.archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-regression-testing-<scope>-aborted/` first.

---

## When to run each suite

| Suite | Workflow file | Duration | Use when |
|-------|---------------|----------|----------|
| `regression` | `regression.yml` | 20-60 min | Pre-release validation, nightly full run |
| `smoke` | `smoke.yml` | 2-5 min | Post-deploy health check, `@critical` only |
| `sanity` | `sanity.yml` | 1-10 min | Validate one feature / one file / one grep pattern |

If the user says "run regression" with no qualifier, default to `regression` on `{{DEFAULT_ENV}}`. If they say "smoke" or "critical only", use `smoke`. If they specify a file, grep, or single feature, use `sanity`.

---

## Local reporting (Allure 3, no global install)

Allure 3 is a devDep — `bunx allure` resolves to the local `node_modules/.bin/allure`, no `brew install allure` / `scoop install allure` required. Configuration lives at `allurerc.mjs`, single-plugin BY DESIGN: with only the **Awesome** plugin the generated `index.html` IS the report (no card-chooser landing), and its top-left mode dropdown covers everything — **Report** (drill-down, tag filters), **Graphs** (complete executive chart set: status, dynamics, severities, stability, testing pyramid, durations…), **Timeline**. Never add `plugin-dashboard` instances — they duplicate Graphs with fewer charts and bring back the landing screen (rationale in `allurerc.mjs` comments). Trend charts are fed by `historyPath: ./.allure/history.jsonl` and populate from the 2nd run onward.

| Use case | Script | Underlying command |
|---|---|---|
| Run tests + auto-generate report (human review) | `bun allure:run` | `bunx allure run -- bun test` |
| Run tests + emit markdown for AI review | `bun allure:agent` | `bunx allure agent -- bun test` |
| Generate report from existing `./allure-results` | `bun allure:generate` | `bunx allure generate ./allure-results` |
| Serve last generated report locally | `bun allure:open` | `bunx allure open` |
| Live-refresh report during iterative dev | `bun allure:watch` | `bunx allure watch ./allure-results` |

`bun allure:agent` is the AI-friendly entry point: it produces a markdown summary the orchestrator (or a Verifier subagent) can read directly without parsing HTML. Use it whenever you need a structured pass/fail breakdown after a local re-run while triaging a CI failure (Phase 2 step 1, before downloading the merged-allure-results artifact from CI).

CI artifacts (`merged-allure-results-{env}`) are still produced by the workflow and downloaded via `gh run download` as documented in Phase 2. The published GitHub Pages reports are generated by `scripts/ci/publish-allure-pages.ts` with the SAME `allurerc.mjs` and `allure` devDep as local runs — the `/{env}/{suite}/` URL redirects straight into the latest run's Awesome report (Report | Graphs | Timeline), with per-suite trend history and last-10-runs retention.

### Allure version-currency check (MANDATORY during any Allure/Pages setup)

The boilerplate pins `allure` / `allure-playwright` / `allure-js-commons` at scaffold time, so by the time someone installs the repo and runs this setup they are usually behind upstream. Whenever this skill performs **Allure setup** (first local report, preflight RED on the "Allure 3 local" row) or **GitHub Pages setup** (`references/github-pages-setup.md`), run this check FIRST:

1. `npm view allure version && npm view allure-playwright version` → compare against `package.json`.
2. **Same major behind** → summarize the news for the user (release notes: `gh api repos/allure-framework/allure3/releases`), then offer `bun update allure allure-playwright allure-js-commons` (or bump the `^` ranges + `bun install`). Keep `allure-js-commons` in lockstep with `allure-playwright` (it is imported directly by `tests/components/TestFixture.ts` for the `layer` auto-label).
3. **New major available** → NEVER upgrade silently. Present breaking changes and wait for explicit user approval.
4. **Config-currency (older scaffolds)** — `bun run update` syncs skills and appends new devDeps, but it NEVER overwrites `allurerc.mjs` or `tests/components/TestFixture.ts` (project-adapted files). If the local `allurerc.mjs` predates the current template (no `historyPath`, no `categories`, or stale `plugin-dashboard` instances), OFFER to migrate it: fetch the boilerplate's current `allurerc.mjs` as reference (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upex-galaxy/agentic-qa-boilerplate/main/allurerc.mjs`), preserve the project's `name`, and port the config. Same for the `_allureLayer` auto-fixture in `TestFixture.ts` (feeds the testingPyramid + durations-by-layer charts in Awesome's Graphs tab) — without it those charts render empty. Never overwrite silently; show the diff and wait for approval.
5. After any bump: `bun allure:generate` from existing results (or a sandbox run) and confirm the report renders — the root `index.html` must open the Awesome report directly, with the Report | Graphs | Timeline mode dropdown working.

Known gotchas to preserve on upgrade (context in `allurerc.mjs` comments):
- Dashboard chart `type` values must match `ChartType` in `@allurereport/charts-api` — the plugin README's `trend`/`pie` examples are stale and yield an empty dashboard (404 on `widgets/charts.json`).
- `historyPath` must stay OUTSIDE `allure-report/` (`./.allure/history.jsonl`) or `test:clean` erases trend history.
- Multiple instances of one plugin need an explicit `import:` field — a custom key alone does not resolve (relevant only if a project deliberately adds extra report views).

---

## Phase 1 — Execute

### Preflight (always)

```bash
gh auth status
gh repo view --json name,owner
gh workflow list
```

If `gh` is not authenticated, stop and ask the user to run `gh auth login`. Do not proceed.

**Write `.session/regression-testing/<scope>/plan.md`** per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §6 BEFORE the Trigger step below. Capture: Goal (suite + env + reason for run), Inputs (workflow file path, env vars, optional grep/test_file for sanity), Approach (subagent pattern per stage from the dispatch table above), Phase breakdown (Trigger → Monitor → Download → Classify → Compute → Report → Verdict), Risks, Verification checklist (all 3 artifacts download + verdict emitted), Cross-references (`.context/reports/regression-<env>-<date>.md` will hold the final verdict). `RUN_ID` lands in `plan.md` §Inputs AFTER the Trigger step captures it — append, do not rewrite the body.

### Trigger

```bash
# Full regression
gh workflow run regression.yml \
  -f environment=staging \
  -f video_record=false \
  -f generate_allure=true

# Smoke
gh workflow run smoke.yml -f environment=staging -f generate_allure=true

# Sanity (grep OR test_file, never both)
gh workflow run sanity.yml -f environment=staging -f test_type=e2e -f grep="@auth"
gh workflow run sanity.yml -f environment=staging -f test_file="tests/e2e/auth/login.test.ts"
```

### Capture run ID

```bash
# Wait 3-5 seconds for the run to register, then:
gh run list --workflow=regression.yml --limit=1 --json databaseId,status,createdAt -q '.[0].databaseId'
```

Store as `RUN_ID`. Every subsequent step uses it.

**Progress checkpoint after Trigger**: append `RUN_ID` to `.session/regression-testing/<scope>/plan.md` §Inputs (so resume can re-attach) AND append a phase entry `## Phase 1.Trigger — <ts>` with `status: completed`, `next: Phase 1.Monitor`, `notes: RUN_ID=<value>` to `progress.md`. This is the critical persistence point — Trigger landing without `RUN_ID` persisted means resume cannot re-attach.

### Monitor to completion

Use the dispatch defined in §Subagent Dispatch Strategy: **Background**. Delegate `gh run watch <RUN_ID>` to a Monitor subagent so the main thread is freed to prepare the report scaffold and load the classification rubric. See `references/ci-cd-integration.md` §"Monitoring the workflow run (Background dispatch)" for the full briefing.

Reference command (executed inside the subagent, not inline on the main thread):

```bash
gh run watch <RUN_ID> --exit-status
# Fallback polling (only if gh run watch is unavailable):
gh run view <RUN_ID> --json status,conclusion
# status: queued | in_progress | completed
# conclusion (only when completed): success | failure | cancelled | timed_out
```

Do not start Phase 2 until the Monitor returns `status: completed`.

### Output of Phase 1

A short execution summary with: workflow name, run ID, environment, duration, conclusion, per-job status, artifact list, and the Allure URL pattern `https://{owner}.github.io/{repo}/{environment}/{suite}/`.

Read `references/ci-cd-integration.md` when configuring new workflows, debugging CI-only failures, tuning sharding / retries / timeouts, or wiring up secrets and variables.

---

## Phase 2 — Analyze

### Step 1: Collect data

Use the dispatch defined in §Subagent Dispatch Strategy: **Parallel** for the three artifact downloads (allure / evidence / playwright). Fan out three subagents in a single tool-call block — each owns one artifact, writes to its own directory, and reports back when its download is verified. The metadata reads (`gh run view`) stay inline because they are short.

Reference commands (the metadata reads run inline; the three `gh run download` calls live inside the parallel subagents):

```bash
# Inline (main thread): full run context
gh run view <RUN_ID> --json status,conclusion,jobs,createdAt,updatedAt,url,headBranch,event,actor

# Inline (main thread): failed logs only (much smaller than --log)
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log-failed

# Inline (main thread): list artifacts so the parallel dispatchers know what to fetch
gh run view <RUN_ID> --json artifacts --jq '.artifacts[].name'

# Parallel subagent A — allure results
gh run download <RUN_ID> -n merged-allure-results-staging -D ./analysis/

# Parallel subagent B — failure evidence (screenshots, traces, videos)
gh run download <RUN_ID> -n e2e-failure-evidence       -D ./analysis/evidence/

# Parallel subagent C — playwright HTML report
gh run download <RUN_ID> -n e2e-playwright-report      -D ./analysis/playwright/
```

Each subagent uses the briefing shape in `agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md` §"Parallel — Download 3 CI artifacts in regression-testing". Cap the fan-out at 3 — there are only ever three artifact streams and GitHub's per-run rate limits are not a concern at that size.

### Step 2: Parse results

Source of truth priority: **Allure results JSON > Playwright `report.json` > raw logs**. Each Allure result has `status`, `statusDetails.message`, `statusDetails.trace`, and `labels[]` (look for `testId` = ATC ID, `suite`, and `severity`).

> **The `suite` label is tag-derived — single source of truth.** Allure suite/grouping labels are NOT a separate taxonomy: they derive from the Playwright tag (`@smoke` / `@regression` / `@e2e` / `@integration` / `@critical`) that also drives CI scope selection. A test tagged `@integration` reports `suite: integration` automatically. So the `suite` you read here is exactly the scope CI ran — never reconcile it against a parallel Allure label set. Convention owner: `test-automation/references/ci-integration.md` §3.2.1.

### Step 3: Compute metrics

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| Total | count of results |
| Passed / Failed / Skipped / Broken | count by `status` |
| Pass Rate | `Passed / Total * 100` |
| Duration | `max(stop) - min(start)` |
| Trend | current pass rate − previous run pass rate |

> **Exclude KNOWN-BLOCKED from the gating pass-rate.** Tests classified
> KNOWN-BLOCKED (tagged `@blocked:{BUG-KEY}`, see Step 4) are parked behind an
> already-filed bug — they are NOT regression failures and must not depress the
> pass-rate that drives the GO/NO-GO score. Compute the gating Pass Rate over
> `Total − KNOWN-BLOCKED`, and report the blocked count separately (with each
> `{BUG-KEY}`) so the release decision is not gamed in either direction.

Previous-run comparison requires downloading artifacts of the previous run:

```bash
PREV=$(gh run list --workflow=regression.yml --limit=2 --json databaseId -q '.[1].databaseId')
gh run download $PREV -n merged-allure-results-staging -D ./analysis/previous/
```

### Step 4: Classify every failure

Use the dispatch defined in §Subagent Dispatch Strategy: **Parallel** when the failure list has more than 10 entries. Shard the failures into chunks of ~10 (cap at 10 subagents) and fan out one classification subagent per chunk; merge their JSON reports in the main thread. For ≤10 failures, classify inline (the dispatch overhead is not justified). See `references/failure-classification.md` §"Parallel classification (default for >10 failures)" for the full briefing and merge protocol.

Apply this decision tree to each failed test (whether classified inline or inside a parallel subagent). **Never mark a test REGRESSION without checking history first** — that is the single most common misclassification.

```
Failed test
  │
  ├── Tagged @blocked:{BUG-KEY}? ────────────► KNOWN-BLOCKED
  │   (test asserts test.fail('Blocked by {BUG-KEY}') — a deliberately
  │    parked test, not a fresh regression; excluded from gating pass-rate)
  │
  ├── Linked to a known-issue ticket? ───────► KNOWN ISSUE
  │
  ├── Error matches environment pattern? ────► ENVIRONMENT ISSUE
  │   (ECONNREFUSED, ETIMEDOUT, net::ERR_, Navigation timeout,
  │    browserType.launch, 502/503, context deadline exceeded)
  │
  ├── No history (first-ever run)? ──────────► NEW TEST FAILURE
  │
  ├── Failure rate > 20% over last 10 runs? ─► FLAKY
  │
  └── Passed in last ≤ 5 runs, now fails? ───► REGRESSION   (release blocker)
```

| Category | Impact | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| KNOWN-BLOCKED | LOW | Already tracked by `{BUG-KEY}` — exclude from gating pass-rate, list in report with the blocking bug key. **No new Jira bug** (the marker already names the open bug) |
| REGRESSION | HIGH | Block release, file Jira Bug/Defect (Phase 3 §File defects in Jira, doctrine Part 1), assign |
| FLAKY | MEDIUM | Schedule stabilization, do not block — **no Jira bug** |
| KNOWN ISSUE | LOW | Document against existing ticket, do not block — **no new Jira bug** |
| ENVIRONMENT | MEDIUM | Re-run after infra check — **no Jira bug** |
| NEW TEST | LOW | Manual verification → if a genuine product defect, file Jira Bug/Defect; else accept or fix |

> **KNOWN-BLOCKED — consuming the blocked-test marker.** The `@blocked:{BUG-KEY}`
> tag + `test.fail('Blocked by {BUG-KEY}')` marker is **defined in
> `test-automation`** (`references/automation-standards.md` §7 Stability; the
> `PROGRESS.md` blocked-tests note lives in `references/planning-playbook.md`) —
> this skill only *consumes* it. The GO/NO-GO gate MUST recognize `@blocked:{BUG-KEY}` tests and
> classify them as **KNOWN-BLOCKED, never REGRESSION**: they are deliberately
> parked behind an already-filed bug, not a fresh failure. Exclude them from the
> pass-rate that gates the release (see §Compute metrics), and list each in the
> report under its own heading with the blocking `{BUG-KEY}`. Do NOT file a new
> Jira bug — the marker already names the open one.

> **`sdet` CI-fallback clause** (integration-trunk suites only): an ENVIRONMENT-class red on a Sanity-CI run for a ticket branch may authorize merging **into the integration trunk** — never the final `trunk → main` PR — when proven by BOTH (a) the change passing locally on `local` AND `staging`, and (b) the same red being present independent of the change (nightly already red, or the failing line is shared pre-existing code). File a separate infra/flake ticket and reference it in the PR. This is NOT a relaxation of the GO bar: a REGRESSION-class failure is never eligible, and the final PR to `main` still requires a genuinely green test step. See `.claude/skills/git-flow-master/references/sdet-integration-trunk.md` §CI-fallback clause.

Read `references/failure-classification.md` when: the decision tree is ambiguous, you need the full error-pattern catalogue, you are classifying a borderline case, or you are computing flakiness over historical runs.

### Step 5: Assess severity per failure

Severity is independent of classification. A FLAKY test on the checkout flow is still CRITICAL severity.

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| CRITICAL | Core user journey (login, checkout, payment). Any `@critical` tagged test. |
| HIGH | Major feature (search, profile, dashboard) |
| MEDIUM | Secondary feature (filters, preferences) |
| LOW | Edge case or admin-only path |

### Output of Phase 2

An analysis block with: metrics table, trend delta, one section per failure category (Regressions first, then Flaky, Known, Environment, New), per-failed-test detail (name, ATC ID, suite, error, last-pass date, screenshot link), job summary, and a preliminary verdict.

---

## Phase 3 — Report & Decide

### GO / CAUTION / NO-GO scoring

Compute a weighted score from the analysis. Maximum is 9.

| Factor | +3 | +1 | 0 | -1 | -2 | -3 |
|--------|----|----|---|----|----|----|
| Pass Rate | ≥ 95% | 90–95% | | | < 90% | |
| Regressions | 0 | 1-2 Low | | 1+ Medium | | Any High/Critical |
| Critical tests | All pass | | | | | Any fail |
| Flaky tests | | ≤ 3 | 4-5 | > 5 | | |

**Verdict thresholds:**
- Score **≥ 7** → **GO** — release approved
- Score **4-6** → **CAUTION** — manual review required, document accepted risks
- Score **< 4** → **NO-GO** — block release, fix regressions, re-run

Never auto-GO if: any `@critical` test fails, any REGRESSION with HIGH/CRITICAL severity exists, or pass rate < 90%. These are hard vetoes regardless of score.

### File defects in Jira (when decision = NO-GO or CAUTION with regressions)

**Only CONFIRMED real product failures become Jira issues.** Use the Phase 2
Step 4 triage as the gate: file in Jira **only** for the `REGRESSION` class and
for a `NEW TEST` failure once it is manually confirmed to be a genuine product
defect (not a bad assertion). **`FLAKY`, `ENVIRONMENT`, and `KNOWN ISSUE` do NOT
get a Jira bug** — they route to stabilization / infra / the existing ticket as
the classification table already prescribes. The failure-triage classification
and the defect issue-type are **separate axes**: triage decides *whether* to
file; the doctrine decides *what type* and *what fields*.

For each issue that clears the gate:

1. **Classify Bug vs Defect** by the affected feature's lifecycle stage, NOT by
   where the failure ran (doctrine Part 1): the regressed feature is **already
   live above Staging (production / superior env)** → **Bug**; the feature is
   still **pre-release (Staging or below)** → **Defect**. A genuinely new,
   desirable behavior surfaced beyond the AC → **Improvement** (Part 1).
2. **File it in Jira with the full mandatory field matrix** (doctrine Part 5):
   `severity` (impact-based) → `priority` auto-derived (Part 5.1), native
   `components` = affected product module (Part 3, mandatory & pre-existing),
   `root_cause` + `error_type` + `test_environment`, `qa_assignee` = the
   authenticated session user (self; never-overwrite, Part 2), and `evidence`
   (Allure link + failure screenshots/traces/logs from `./analysis/evidence/`).
3. **Parent to the QA Defect Management epic** — the QA process epic
   (`qa.qa_epics.defect_epic.name`), found-or-created; NEVER a product/dev epic
   (Part 4).
4. **Link to the source Story/feature** for traceability via the causal link
   (Part 4) — the regressed ATC's covering Story.
5. **Write via acli/REST** (doctrine Part 6): create with acli
   `workitem create --from-json` (create-time customfields under
   `additionalAttributes.customfield_*`, native `components:[{name}]`); set
   customfields/components on an existing issue via REST `PUT
   /rest/api/3/issue/{KEY}`; `qa_assignee` is read-before-write. Because this
   stage may run **from CI**, **load `/acli` first** (it owns auth, syntax, and
   the REST-PUT pattern in `references/acli-integration.md`).

Run the doctrine's **filing gate** (Part 9) before submitting each issue. Save
the returned Jira key to reference in the report.

### TMS sync (optional, when `[TMS_TOOL]` is configured via `.agents/project.yaml` `testing.tms_cli`)

> **Prerequisite**: Load `/xray-cli` skill (Modality jira-xray) before executing the `[TMS_TOOL]` commands below. In Modality jira-native, load `/acli` instead and map test-execution operations to native Jira issues (see `test-documentation/references/jira-setup.md`).

The sprint regression maps to two Jira **items** (items-first by excellence — the Story custom field is never used at this altitude):

- **STP** (Sprint Test Plan) — a **Test Plan** item titled `STP: Sprint#{N}: Regression` (e.g. `STP: Sprint#30: Regression`). Parents to the **QA Master Test Plan** epic (`qa.qa_epics.master_test_plan_epic.name`); `relates to` the Sprint.
- **STR** (Sprint Test Results) — a **Test Execution** item titled `STR: Sprint#{N}: Regression Testing` (e.g. `STR: Sprint#30: Regression Testing`). Parents to the **QA Test Artifacts** epic (`qa.qa_epics.test_artifacts_epic.name`); `relates to` the Sprint; `testPlan` → STP. The run's term is **Regression Testing** — "Sprint" already comes from the `Sprint#{N}` scope-id, so the title carries no redundant "Sprint Regression".

The `Update Test Execution` below targets the **STR** item.

```
[TMS_TOOL] Update Test Execution:
  executionKey: {STR execution-key}
  results: {per-ATC status + failure comments from Phase 2}
```

### Write the report

Save to `.context/reports/regression-{env}-{date}.md`. Use `references/failure-classification.md` only if you need the pattern catalogue; the report template itself is inline below.

---

## Report template

```markdown
# Regression Quality Report — {env} — {date}

## Executive Summary
**Verdict: {GO / CAUTION / NO-GO}**
Score: {score}/9. {one-line rationale}

| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Pass Rate | {x}% | >= 95% | {ok/warn/fail} |
| Regressions | {n} | 0 | {ok/warn/fail} |
| Critical failures | {n} | 0 | {ok/warn/fail} |
| Flaky | {n} | <= 3 | {ok/warn/fail} |
| Duration | {d} | - | - |

## Release Blockers
{if NO-GO, enumerate regressions with severity, owner, ETA. Otherwise: "None."}

## Failure Details
### Regressions ({n})
  - {test} | {atc_id} | last passed {date} | [issue]({url}) | probable cause: {...}

### Flaky ({n}) — schedule stabilization
### Known Issues ({n}) — accepted
### Known-Blocked ({n}) — excluded from gating pass-rate
  - {test} | {atc_id} | blocked by [{BUG-KEY}]({url})
### Environment ({n}) — re-run after infra check

## Trend (last 5 runs)
{ASCII sparkline or pass-rate table}

## Links
- Workflow run: {url}
- Allure: {url}
- Created issues: {list}
- TMS execution: {key / url}

## Recommendations
1. Immediate (pre-release): {...}
2. Short-term (this sprint): {...}
3. Long-term (tech debt): {...}
```

### Post-decision actions

| Decision | Actions |
|----------|---------|
| GO | Mark release candidate approved; schedule post-deploy smoke |
| CAUTION | Review with team lead; document accepted risks; proceed deliberately |
| NO-GO | Block release; assign regression issues; schedule fix verification; plan re-run |

### Per-phase progress + Archive

After Phase 1 Monitor returns, after each Phase 2 step (Collect / Parse / Compute / Classify / Severity), and after Phase 3 Verdict, the orchestrator appends a phase entry to `.session/regression-testing/<scope>/progress.md` per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §7. `artifacts_touched` records the downloaded CI artifacts (allure / evidence / playwright dirs) + the final `.context/reports/regression-<env>-<date>.md`.

After the Verdict emits, the orchestrator runs Archive per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md` §8: moves `.session/regression-testing/<scope>/` to `.session/.archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-regression-testing-<scope>/` (two-file dir preserved) and calls `mem_session_summary` with the archive path. The canonical `.context/reports/regression-<env>-<date>.md` stays in the reports dir as the committed deliverable.

On Verdict = NO-GO with regressions still being filed as issues, archive WAITS until the issue-creation step completes (so the session state still references the open issue list at archive time).

## Gotchas

- **Allure URL is predictable but only live after the "Build & Deploy Allure Report" job succeeds.** If that job failed, the URL 404s — analyze from downloaded artifacts instead.
- **`gh run watch` can time out** on long suites. Fall back to polling `gh run view <RUN_ID> --json status` every 60-90 seconds.
- **`gh run view --log` dumps every step's output** and is often >50MB on large suites. Always prefer `--log-failed` during analysis; use `--job=<JOB_ID> --log` for targeted drilldown.
- **Retries mask flakiness.** Playwright is configured with `retries: 2` in CI. A test that passes on retry is still flaky — inspect `retries` count in Allure, not just final status.
- **ENVIRONMENT is not a scapegoat.** `ECONNREFUSED` to your app's own API probably means the app crashed, not "infra glitch". Check if the same run has many unrelated tests failing on the same host — that is environment. One test failing with a network error on an endpoint that other tests hit successfully is more likely a REGRESSION.
- **Never mark NEW TEST as REGRESSION.** A first-ever failure with no history is not a regression — it is unverified. Manually confirm once before classifying.
- **Flakiness needs 10 runs of history minimum.** If you don't have 10 runs, mark it as "insufficient history" and re-evaluate next sprint. Do not guess.
- **Sanity + `grep` and `test_file` are mutually exclusive.** Passing both makes the workflow ignore one silently. Pick one.
- **Video recording inflates artifact size by 5-10x.** Only enable `video_record=true` when debugging flakiness or capturing bug evidence. Never enable it for nightly regression.
- **CI credentials come from GitHub secrets, not `.env`.** Do not copy values from local `.env` into workflow YAML — reference `${{ secrets.NAME }}` only.

## Specific tasks

* **Configuring or debugging GitHub Actions workflows** — read `references/ci-cd-integration.md`
* **Enabling GitHub Pages so the published Allure reports are browsable ("set up GitHub Pages", "report URL is 404", "publish the reports site")** — read `references/github-pages-setup.md` (enable via `gh api`, first-build stuck/errored gotcha + manual rebuild, gh-pages history squash job). Run the §Allure version-currency check first.
* **Setting up Allure locally for the first time, or the user asks "is Allure up to date?"** — run the §Allure version-currency check under §Local reporting.
* **Classifying a borderline failure (REGRESSION vs FLAKY vs ENVIRONMENT)** — read `references/failure-classification.md`
* **TMS / Xray result import** — load `/xray-cli` skill
* **Downloading traces or screenshots for a failure** — use `[AUTOMATION_TOOL]` per CLAUDE.md Tool Resolution; for Playwright trace inspection load `/playwright-cli`
* **Session contract (Phase 0 resume, plan.md/progress.md schemas, archive policy, Engram per-phase checkpoint, RUN_ID re-attach mechanism)** — read `../agentic-qa-core/references/session-management.md`. This skill is a producer of `session/regression-testing/<scope>/...` topic keys.

## Anti-patterns — NEVER do these

- **R1.** NEVER classify a failure as FLAKY without re-running the test in isolation — masks real regressions.
- **R2.** NEVER emit GO when known REGRESSION class > 0 — quality gate is binary: regressions block.
- **R3.** NEVER auto-retry failing tests in CI without surfacing the retry count in the report.
- **R4.** NEVER skip Allure artifact download on red builds — evidence vanishes after the retention window.
- **R5.** NEVER trigger a regression workflow without `--ref <commit-sha>` pinned — different commit = different baseline.
- **R6.** NEVER mix smoke + regression suite results into one pass-rate number — different SLOs.
- **R7.** NEVER mark a test KNOWN-failure without a Jira ticket linking the suppression to a tracking issue.
